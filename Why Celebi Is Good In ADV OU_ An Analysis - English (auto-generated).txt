what's up guys today we're doing Celebi

and a tou and why it is good those 100

base stats across the board they're

pretty good grass typing is notable

defensively and psychic can be a track

sometimes but it can also be a boon so

we will explore all that and more

ranging from Selby's impressive move

full - how its unpredictability lets it

function how it's sometimes really

difficult to deal with even if you know

exactly what's going over all these are

traits of a good pok√©mon so let's get

started by saying that every single

Celebi ever will be carrying the item

leftovers and that's pretty much all you

can know for a guarantee so the

trademark to Celebi said that it is most

known for and stereotypically associated

with is the defensive set running around

this much HP having recover and usually

leech seed now the leech seed is amazing

of course because it stabs the point

while healing you in a common condition

like sandstorm that's 12% on something

that's not going to heal other than from

maybe a wish pass or perhaps Celebi

soclean seen stereotypically this set

also is old because it likes to switch

into Snorlax and that help fend off

things like Metagross also not being

immediately terrified of physical

salamence Aerodactyl and sometimes even

teat are push comes to shove so the

amount of defense a runs can really vary

but generally it's something around this

number is safe - it's - and then it can

run some speed for an ATAR and then

carry on some special attack it can run

some special defense for things like

Gengar ice punch and electric-type

hidden power ice is like dab dose and

even stray fire blasts but this is the

stereotypical set that helps spend off

Snorlax notably

so I these newbies look very scattered

and that's because Celebi is a Pokemon

it's very hard to uh it's hard to suss

out what v's its using even when you're

facing it you can make a guess what it's

kind of spread it's running like you can

guess it's definitely physically

defensive but it's really gonna be hard

to tell how much defense exactly it has

unless you do a million calyx and even

then it's like well it could be this

much but it also could be this much and

that leaves a lot of assumptions or

ideally educated informed guesses about

what else it's running like if it's got

smells but F because the guys team needs

to soak Starmie ice beam a little better

or if it's got some special attack for

Dugtrio as we'll see in a minute things

of that nature so uh it could also run

more defense obviously but yeah so Litzy

other moves it's notable it doesn't

really run this as much as it did in the

past when advanced was the main gem but

it was also notable for having like

awesome support moves like he'll bail

and para song he'll bail is obviously

awesome team support and so he doesn't

have to waste it on itself because of

natural cure being incredible in a tier

with tons of toxics gang cars will oeis

even sterilize his body slam since it's

a prime counter that's huge but he'll

bail humps its teammates and parasol is

great for last Pokemon set up like most

traditionally suicune and Snorlax for

Celebi Ward's off throughout the game

with leech seed but at the end of the

game you might need that pair song for

the game winner

so it's also obviously you know if their

last Pokemon it's like a DD mints or

something then you just plant sell me in

front of it and it's like okay well now

we can't sweeping so yes however more

traditionally you're going to want your

Celebi to go on the offensive at least a

little so psychic could stab move

Gengar big arrow cross switches

salamence switching really useful and

you can also go with a second stab move

which is hidden power grass and that is

primarily for Taranis mark is sometimes

you're gonna have to brawl with it and

sometimes you're gonna actually want to

hit those water times putting it on like

Milotic suicune Swampert especially

Swampert is very likely to not initially

but on a leech seed or a recover stay in

an ice beam was to get get some more

lefties in the case to further cover

because you can protect after for even

more or just mostly bad but if you

expect to leave see than you forced to

recover after reinforce it somewhat

depending on how much special attack

unless when the person has fence the

Selby has and so that they're switching

does have to eat elite see something

like a Snorlax in sand

no offense it relaxes and eating leech

really really sucks because you're gonna

want that Snorlax to a hit or two at

least it competes it so it's better to

put on the pressure it's better to be

pressured less of course so yeah that is

why you would run HP grass but also

transfer but another big reason is duck

trio duck trio is a thorn in Celebi side

Celebi is the reason why Dugtrio runs

hidden power buck so you ever doubt

always influence on this here that's it

yes so and that is why the lots of

defense helps because don't you know I

believe that the number for avoiding a

dark tree okay Oh with Celebi

and jolly and he anyway excuse me is

somewhere around the three 90s

so obviously but the more defense the

better because you can't count on it

being a pristine and pristine health all

the time especially what it's switching

me to so many attacks as you would

expect from the defensive Pokemon

you know because unless you want to use

recover every single time you eat a

Zapdos thunderbolt so now while some

people like doing that because in

generation pretty recover has an

incredible 32 PP but generally not

preferred another underrated move is

oh I should also mention that for okhla

stuck trio then you will run forty or

forty four Special Attack to guarantee

the OCO on both lists forty guarantees

on four HP or zero HP because most of

them will run for HP or for defense for

CB tar rockslide and if they randomly

throw it in special defense than forty

four number but you know so if you're

even crunching then keep that in mind

might save you but even if you have 40

versus the force but everyone it's still

a 94 percent chance to kill it anyway

another underrated move is reflects this

does not get a ton of use but it is

recognized as an option because it is I

mean obviously it helps a ton with duck

trio but even just physical attackers in

general like your CB tars and your CV

grosses and your arrows and your menses

and Snorlax it's just incredibly useful

it's so like it's not just telling me

that it makes hard to kill it's

everything becoming harder to tell your

CV growth you know blowing up and

slicing through Skarmory you know not

gonna happen so it's an incredible tool

very very useful and it's like again HP

grass HP grasses the lone move is also

useful of course it's just that um

Gengar is breath and sometimes a lot of

people want that security against it

yeah so reflect is the who is a more

recognized option of course now some

players very few sometimes there are

light screen but I must say this is more

but

specific auxiliary option for teams that

for players who are using teams that

they really know how they function it's

not just flight screen for the sake of

light screen it's not something you slap

on because but it is mentioned however

reflect is the more standard and yeah

you can have other options like hidden

power fire if you're trying to wear down

scar rate the Scarberry is huge thorn in

defensive Selby's side because I mean

the sand I mean leaf she doesn't really

bug it that much but it's also gonna you

know it it really means that extra hit

with a to be fire sometimes if you're

really trying to bring the Skarmory down

gradually since you are running a

defensive team and most defensive teams

don't exactly have offense to feast on

scar mary's present i mean some

offensive skews don't really about fist

on stories prison so sometimes you're

gonna have to go with the gradual

approach and also it's good against

fortress and it can even tap other

celebi who are looking to absorb a elite

students come in games with defense

elevates you know please see the only a

16 PP which is crucial um

oh now that we're on the topic of

scarring fortress and spikes then at

least it of course goes really well with

spikes but 16 pv can really really bite

it if you over rely on it it's a great

cool but in longer games over reliance

on it and just spamming it every which

way is that when you really need it then

it will very often bite you especially

when a rest Zapdos switches into it or

when you're using it as a counter

suicune both of that pressure not

sustainable in the long run you gotta

have another plan so HP fire is also

nice for Metagross who resist psychic

and HP grass it was like alright well

I'm at you know insert low health range

at like anywhere from like 10 to only

not tanning probably live each

progressed with there but you know 15 to

30 percent and you're like alright well

so out of range so I good to take

something out with a boom in description

and then you would run either psychic or

Giga Drain

if you are still looking for duck show

but the lower BP Giga Drain has as

opposed to the HP grass means that your

your accountant gets dunked you're gonna

be not so hot so I mean if you have

spikes then that helps but yeah so this

is the classic defensive salary I don't

believe I'm missing any options any

notable options so yeah that's that

looks to be about it

so all mine leach tel-aviv

it's how mine recover leech seed and

mostly psychic and you may be thinking

well what the heck isn't this just the

defensive set with call mind yes and no

yes because yeah no because I'm not

going to say it focuses more as more of

a sweeper but it definitely gives you

more offensive options now I think about

so I think it's established enough as

its own set to war in its own spot my

guess before I go there I should come

back to this for a second this set can

you know moved stuff aside it can run

calm and special defensive these you

know with some defense but it makes it a

huge difference in taking special

attacks like what ice beams from waters

and in cases from electrics and like

crunch from for suiting to Minotaur

simple move sets of course but yeah and

it can also go fast or faster because

sometimes heracross and offensive

suicune are annoying yes actually if

your main or slash only counter to

offensive suicune is a defensive Televi

then you will be out running 2k out so

some people say well I you know feel

bulky want me to go up here and you know

as a bonus I'm less threatened by the

terrifying heracross or the few Pokemon

that is able to consistently Oh coast

elevate so I mean obviously it wants to

be careful about the sidekick remember

the Swampert ice beam principle but you

know if you're a fast HP grass then

you're a lot less pressure

because you can both threaten the PERT

and threaten the air across and you can

spend that to your advantage

anyway now that that's covered they'll

be can't feasibly go even faster and

just you know like 300 s for like meds

and stuff

ments and things around there but

generally it will prefer the bulk

however the zoo and benchmark is crucial

because salvia is often one of the

team's better defensive options against

suicune so yeah so the call mine said

this is pretty much your standard Beach

Celebi except it can also force the

issue

for example we spoke of HP fired dinking

scarm as they tried to spike and of

course that is nice but the leash set

the pure leach set sometimes has

problems forcing the issue you know

against your Snorlax and suicune so you

have to have other options or you have

to fit para song in there somehow which

is a really tough ask and call mine is a

way to kind of have your cake and eat it

too because you smacks farm around I

mean you don't really smack it but with

leech seed let's say you leech it on the

switch you call mine as a spike and then

you psychic now things are happening

it's not going to enjoy that especially

if it whirlwind to you it's still taking

leak and whatever got real winded and

got healed up if it wasn't already full

it's more offensive the way of

threatening Zapdos who just wants to sit

on you sir on since creeping around be

some big ones too but yeah and it so I

think it's big other this spread wise

it's pretty much the same thing as the

other one you know with your bold or

your calm usually bold though usually

bolts it's calm binding um you know with

your speed options available of course

HP grass also an option but most players

prefer to Dugtrio the tar and have the

overall superior coverage of psychic

which is great for Salamence horseman

frost yeah call mines

prefers the higher BP of psychic yeah

this is a this is a very notable set

just like the defensive one worth noting

that the defensive set also since it is

scar bait than Magneton

of course makes a great partner but as

we will continuously explore in this

video then Magneton shall be you have

quite a Dugtrio weakness but we'll get

to that

where Celebi can hit handle it itself

but them to consider given spikes and

all that so this is defensive coal mined

pretty much the same you know you're 270

or your you know you're beating endeavor

pert and then you're bold and you're

bold

most people max but you know you're good

amount of Defense some special defense

with mono psyche you don't really run

special expects you're not really going

to be yo killing Doug so alright offense

even after combine so offensive call

mines the other side of that coin so

this is thinking well you are not

walling this with farm because it is

Mac's special attack the standard set is

timid used to hang around this much for

salamence because this last move was

psychic and you know now it would

probably go up to no more 308 for

Moltres and a lot of bulky Gengar you

can you know get into a hole speed

pre-war thing here well the reason you

don't go max is because with HP fire

you're not tying men's flag on Zapdos

Jirachi so you may as well get some bulk

out of it if you want to tie other HP

fire Selby go for it but let me tell you

that is not us area you ideally really

want happening and the bulk is notable

it's kind of a sweet comfortable sweet

hood is really bulky naturally Celebi is

too but when it's just zero HP I mean

still gonna take a hit it's not like it

suddenly turns into a paper plane but

well let's just say you appreciate all

the bulky can squeeze out of it so most

players prefer to fur to give it some

Pokemon game of inches so don't waste

your full TVs yeah offensive combine

this is just you know it's cute they're

gonna sneeze

but I didn't don't you hate that anyway

so you know your offensive Sam spikes

games like your teat our gang garzke arm

Swampert are really not gonna like this

you have to get out in front though

because if you switch it you know if

it's already getting harassed by spikes

when it comes in and take so much

potential away from it so ideally you

want to do something like force the

Swampert in grab your free call mind to

start hitting things

of course this set does not really love

Lisi and it will often get worn down so

it most often fits on offensive teams

that specialize in either capitalizing

on or removing Blissey the former at the

capitalisation you bait Blissey in maybe

a psychic and giga drain it once or

twice because giga drain again splitty

gives you a lot of health back and you

force a soft-boiled now you're ready

grouse is in your big exploding wall

breaking gun or your hair across or

whatever and now you have the potential

to make things happen

since lb does not invites Carberry in to

spy pon it all the live long day I mean

you can but you're you're going to spike

or you're gonna face it not both so well

also worth mentioning that modest is an

option but most players don't use that

yeah

this says also more ducks Rio pro so in

addition and obviously doesn't really

ward off things like Snorlax so that is

something to keep in mind but yeah and

the removal of Blissey is more

especially offense games with things

like Jirachi and sweetening so you have

something like Gengar Reggie ice that

baits it Blissey and then you boom and

then you Doug

or maybe you somehow dug it without

without even needing to sacrifice

something but then and then your special

guns are really made yeah Toby is very

strong in this role

and is of course don't have any teams so

now that I've mentioned you know

heracross and Celebi on the same team

and you know Hachi is well-endowed trio

I should mention Celebi is part of a

notable adv offense strategy you might

notice a lot of offensive teams just

repeatedly picked off against doe trio

now how often seing them is one thing

yeah like you can send in Celebi I'm the

duck trio earthquake or after pictures

earthquake something and you'll keep

attacking and then when it is HP bugs

keep attacking with something else I

care across but generally you know it

that kill for kill format can be good

some players do use that selfie is

notable because alongside Dugtrio which

you also like for tapping Blissey

is that you can force the other Dugtrio

to lock in HP bug bend your own will be

able to dispatch it so yeah magic that

is a very common combination pair across

is the same with the forcing other big

reveal aerial ace and sometimes you can

you guys can do it these two can do it

for each other so that's notable yeah

other than that isn't straight ahead

sweeper but it has one more trick up its

sleeve and that is baton patch now we're

getting into Celebes Wilders pipe you

know you can say call mine Giga Drain HP

fire those two are threatening by

themselves it's tough to hit ments on

the switch and because you don't want to

psychic and die nothing else really

benefits from it I mean drug you know

sweet who's good ice BB regardless so it

would just be a waste of Selby what can

I do about this actually K you said to

myself e all right like a baton pass

worth mentioning that the rise and

offensive Televi alongside other things

but offensive Selby being a big one is

why jolly choice bans elements rose in

popularity so it's worth mentioning that

you should check your sand damage when

Salomon switches into your cell V so you

don't think I'm gonna pass this guy or

but a fish of all the sagging they use

get prompt so

uh yeah you can I mean do bear in mind

you will be baton passing and intimidate

but since you're passing coal mine

ideally that's not the worst thing in

the world with you then I'm off to a

sweet moon or something no but yeah you

can make your teammates lives a lot

easier

I mean you can already think of a whole

host of applications of how dangerous

passing call mine can be like if you

take a beating setting up two plus six

and then you pass it off to your suicune

who comes in against the and is

healthy then that's you know a lot

easier than sweden setting up two plus

six and trying to beat duplicity no

because it's not like it's getting

uncontested plastic so things of that

nature

over time pets can also bait in

Scarborough or not scarf I mean

Scarborough yeah we'll get to that but

on this kind of set ideally you're

baiting in like a bar Blissey maybe like

Jirachi and Metagross and that makes it

could partner with dog trio so uh yeah

that's that's pretty much this Marian of

Celebi here's another offensive variant

of Salvi I mean it's it's a defensive

set that enables a very specific kind of

often no you're familiar with magnet on

physical offense teams I'm sure you know

you magnet on the spurbury and then you

just wail on things with your Metagross

Salamence heracross guitar Gyarados

whatever sometimes you're like ah man

I'm lacking your power what do you do oh

these water types are ruining my day

they know I'm strong but I'm not strong

enough what do you do enter your Celebi

well it's certainly not going to make

your life against Bo trio any easier

since those teams are already strapped

for spots enough without you know having

an anti dog trio strategy they just

gotta look up and do the best they can

with their game plan how they're going

to maneuver around the double show

itself rather than removing it from the

game things like agility Metagross but

uh with the bulk then this thing can be

a game ender so generally you're going

to run yeah you can run speed 148 for

ments that's the golden standard max HP

and it'll generally do enough with this

you can run slower to have more bulk or

whatever but yeah this this is pretty

simple

after you've magnet onto the Scarberry

perhaps because Celebi baton passed out

of it then you get your physical guy in

and then you bein in the water you know

your per mile oh sweet moon whatever and

then Selby enters easily and swords

dances whatever comes in but Todd passes

and that could be the game right there I

you could be you could give your agility

better goes +2 attack alongside a Lum

berry it's not getting status and boom

you know anything likes a free Swords

Dance of course so I mean even Swampert

you know let's see does encounter and

anymore so yeah bps lb is very dangerous

of course you're thinking well you know

it can't be that easy uh

facing exists roar whirlwind Scarface

not going to be an issue as we already

went over however what could be an issue

is roll around other Pokemon for example

Zapdos and Tyranitar are very common

then they tend to run roar and so

sometimes even Swampert us sweet hood

does too so the answer to that is it's

all these other two moves it tends

sometimes it runs recover but you know

and then it runs an attacking move and

that attacking move is the secret to

success now recover is its so you can

try this this so it's not like a

one-and-done kind of deal you know like

if a belly drops miracle fails to

patatas successfully then you know

that's it your game may as well be over

but I would sell me you can make it

reliable that's why she'll be so

dangerous so the last boot can be hidden

power fighting because FranNet are is a

prime target need to smack it of course

it can also run and you know beating up

on Snorlax is also nice Shadow Ball it's

also an option because Gengar is

annoying and tries to to possible you

camp at table has in the first place and

just anger the worst so that is an

option

you could also ditch recover if you're

thinking hey I'm not going to switch

this into a lot of water type ice beams

ideally you know maybe I pivot to get it

on the earthquake and that HP fighting

and you run two attacks oh you're ready

for everything

I mean roars Aptos universe we are gonna

be annoying but they're also really not

doing that much damage so you can fog is

SB and like hit them and eventually

they're gonna be forced to rest

that's that works better if you use

recover though because unless you manage

to get mag in on the scar as it came in

then it's your plugin to spike and that

twelve percent can go a long way Celebi

is being affected by sandstorm is one of

its few deficiencies and is how many

teams try to explain it as notable with

the offensive savages Weiss and you got

to get it in there before they've

already got their spikes up cuz I mean

jirachi like they compared it with

jirachi

it was like yeah I mean these spice

you're kind of annoying but I'll get it

back in a few turns with leftovers so

not that big a deal zombies not be

afraid um which is nice but it's not

quite the same so uh yeah that's also

notable yeah recover and HP fighting not

all Trant are run I mean if you're

running s deep SLB you're probably

taking a little bit of a gamble so you

might be thinking well the thr just

shouldn't have roar then I hope not

because I mean it's not the most common

move on transpire so it's not unexpected

and even then you know even if even if

they do have that phaser that's going to

stop you that's not necessarily the end

of the game you can still use your

Celebi to stonewall that annoying wall I

think you batad pass out as the trend or

comes in and then you use your offensive

Pokemon that you would be passing to

let's say Metagross that's going to be a

threat anyway Celebi is not it's not

essential to the entire team functioning

it just helps it function at a higher

level if that makes sense

like Metagross is already really scary

it's just that with help from Celebi it

could potentially end the game

immediately but you know with Magneton

then you should already have an

offensive plan that's similar to other

physical Magneton teams so yeah I think

that's it also technically since we're

you know mentioning every for mostly

everything that this off pure SD cell

beset kind of exists it's not that good

but it's okay it's definitely going to

catch someone off-guard

so but yeah SD pass is the notable Selby

said within the advanced meta that you

have to know about not SD pure St

finally more baton pass action yes this

move is very good this is a newer set

and it excels on trap teams and now that

I'm mentioning that that I should

mention that the pure defensive set can

also run baton pass in this last move no

with your psychic recover leach and a

stab move no and then also the table has

useful because you know how I'll be

bathing in magnet on magnets on Garber

et tar blitzie things like that you know

stuffing a twat Jirachi Metagross yeah

it makes her prime canna on trap teams

especially with how good it is that

warding off things like Snorlax and

waters that would otherwise be annoying

so now this set really goes all the way

because you're not just being a

defensive I mean you're not you're

giving up an attacking option but but

the substitute means that max HP

investment is very crucial because it

means you can pass 101 HP substitutes

meaning that if you pass to say well I

mean if whatever you pass to I mean if

you pass to salamence

and Blissett just uses ice cream then it

obviously doesn't get you anywhere but

if you pass to something like Metagross

and then the substance relax them the

substitute will remain intact so yeah

you the Tran tire whatever you you see

the idea because the substitute that's

past is Celebes so the thing receiving

it does not need to have one on one HP

as well anyway this set is pretty

legislate fast as you can sub in the

face of annoying things like

makes men's fireblast some stalling

annoying attacks is also very nice like

that here's a ridiculous example a plus

six combine Blissey and you know it's

already used some ice cubes and you're

just sub stalling because know if it has

to use thunderbolt and that that's a

dumb example but I'm thinking more like

mix mines fire blaster like in a pinch

heracross megahorn it's not a strategy

to rely on but it is an option and yeah

lease it helps you more offensively

leech seed like for example elite seed

Selby that leaches say and HP bug cbiit

are like a call my leech Baron I can't

stay in there but you know the subsea

very they could stay and it'll just sub

and you know the Seas with the tar locks

itself into and you know it gets more

damage on it and you know all as well

things like that so you can see how that

works and Baton Pass also helps you get

your trappers in safely

of course and it really uh baton past

I'll be not necessarily sub but often

sub common uh trap teams with Meg Bob

night reopening Magneton and Doug trio

and then you know with the removal of

scarm tatar brachii Metagross other

celibate of course Blissey then you can

really become scary with suicune and

Snorlax of your own or things like

choice ban settlements I mean Selby

baton passing - Magneton opens up a lot

of things as we've already gone over

well yeah the like the classic trap team

I believe make made or maybe it was fear

one of the two is like ban mints the Tom

pass lb Milo mag Doug and Snorlax I mean

you can throw you can throw your clay

dolls in there if you really want to

just completely destroy scar vert and

uh sorry about that yeah if you want to

just quit destroy Skarmory and it spikes

and he uh sorry unexpected visitor um

gets Carmen its spikes then you get

throw clay doll in there but you can

also throw like sweet food for more

trapped victim abuse jirachi it's great

Metagross is really nice over there

because if it's offensive defensive

utility back up against

Snorlax in case your cell because

Dugtrio that have a plan for that or at

least have a plan to avoid that if your

team really anchors on Celebi so

strongly I think tell be in general it

is good to rely on it because it's it's

reliable of course but you do have to be

very cognizant of its flaws because they

are high-level strategies that are very

common and very powerful so it's not the

most unrealistic but your Selby would

get picked off by a duck trio because it

was out of it was in range thanks to the

spikes and computering it's leftovers so

uh yeah I think that's that's about that

yeah this set is a pretty much always

paired with at least one trapper usually

Magneton if it is the sole trapper but

yeah so we did not go over them

viability rankings yet which was

uncharacteristic of me but yes lb is

firmly entrenched in the a - rank

functions in transpose metagame just

flying I mean this is some elite company

Celebi seve suicune jirachi Snorlax

Alvin's doctor are those who are major

major players this is a business and

alphabetically organized either so Selby

is at the very top so

yeah it's not quite at the consistent

game-breaking level of those above it

but it's still pretty much premier

advanced threat or a premier advanced

threat that you have to be aware of and

take into account because let me tell

you something I mean this holds true for

a lot of the better advanced Pokemon but

like something like let's say take your

pick of these Pokemon you can kind of

forget about them or you'll naturally

check them most of the time I mean they

have their niches which is why they're

here but generally you'll be able to

deal with them one way or another but if

you're just totally left exposed to a

certain cell be very especially the

baton pass ones I mean this one you can

you'll probably be able to naturally

hold off for at least for a little bit a

good player wielding it knows with a

good team knows how to make magic happen

so that's not as done deal but now with

the baton pass parents can get out of

hand very quickly and if you're running

one of those really really fat teams

that just kind of does all its damage

passively somebody's just gonna laugh in

your face is it you can't hurt it that

much it sets up and then it sends it off

to somewhere else

so yeah scary stuff

so we will now do a little demonstration

of common teams with each set or team

outlines at least so the defensive set

so we're gonna do defensive flash call

my leach because they are very similar

offensive call mine and baton that they

are similar SD paths and subsea so

starting with defensive not defensive

can be pretty much I mean

I guess a lot of it sets kind of cross

over so you're not that you're gonna

have to maybe not take this with a grain

of salt but you know use common sense

and seeing how it could apply to other

teams this is obviously not set in stone

in any way so we're just gonna go with

standard stabs but its defensive and I

think we're gonna go with a non Blissey

team because it'll show off calm and

something cool Celebi can do with calm

is ward off gang car since it has

natural cure for will-o-wisp

and that means this Tyranitar does not

have to run a pursuit set instead I can

run the farm more fearsome physical set

which pressure's pretty much the entire

tier and can help be an active safe

active yet safe defensive way of holding

threats off or you can make this a

dragon dancer you know either or dragon

danced on cloth so but basically the

idea of comps I'll be here is that you

don't have to rely on tea tar to remove

anger as most teams would and the last

here would be you know

Zapdos or it can be arrow or it can be

Blissey and you just had make this he'll

be bold but generally you know heracross

is really scary here as you can tell and

if you don't have the Blissey then you

know call was good but offensive sweet

Kahuna is gonna be stronger after coal

mine so you might have to go up to 270

which is not a bad idea to begin with

so you're gonna have your Dugtrio

look show bulk I'm not sure I'm never

sure if Tim intercom is more since the

stats are the same so I'll leave it up

to you guys to play around with it by

this this would generally get the job

done spikes you got your dragon dance or

your physical die no you have your speed

and then you have your defensive set and

then you know Dugtrio works well works

well here as well of course you might

also notice that Mac or Skarmory

opposing Skarmory can be quite annoying

so what some teams do is they run

Magneton instead of a gengar now this

makes Moltres in particular very scary

you got to watch out when you're

stacking these kinds of Pokemon because

it's like a 4 pokemon obliterated by

Moltres though you know maybe your TTR

would run pursue and maybe this could

become like a sub cedar or like a fast

variant basically that could that has

some leeway against Moltres rather than

being completely helpless but uh now the

gangers really encounter but it's faster

you know where as many times gets melted

you might have a offensive abuser of it

here like save you mints so yeah you'll

also notice the bolt this will also make

you worse against Dugtrio so this teat

are now cutesy DD stuff whatever set

ends up being it's gotta be max HP gotta

gotta be protective against Dugtrio so

yeah that's that's an example of

offensive this can also be an example of

sub seed you know this can also be an

arrow you know so see it also helps

against like mixed men's stuff like that

protecting scarm from mag so you can get

it with your own mag things of that

nature of course if you're not running a

selfie that can actually attack Gengar

at all then this would probably pursue

so things like that yeah

so that's defensive for you a rough

outline I mean you can do things like

Zapdos Dugtrio and you know if you know

you're confident that this can bait it

with HP fire or things like that so yeah

basically this is a revelant line and of

course you can throw Blissey in there

like we said yeah um you know defensive

overlap is what the name is what you

would like great Celebi so you mix

putting in certain threats and preserve

what you really need for the other

threat for example against combo of

Metagross and Tyranitar let's say scrum

gets Magneton

you might want to ward off Metagross

with Celebi if you can so it can't

explode on Swampert and then leave you

open to Tyranitar I mean I recognize

that there's a Dugtrio there but it's

more of a general idea alright so

there's that

this could also easily be all mined with

with Blissey or Zapdos and special kinds

of backup you get the idea um yeah

that's defensive and combine so now

let's go to the offensive sets actually

since it's shorter I'm just gonna meet a

sigma sub seed thing I think we already

kind of went over it by Dugtrio this is

gonna be some ass no timid so it's gonna

be fast and you know bulk on it can

really vary some people like must really

like some defense for Dugtrio SOI but

you know Magneton and then you got your

electrons is a primary beneficiary of it

and then you can run like sweet code to

call mind and whatever filler or it can

be Milotic to have more longevity you

can run things like bandha meds you can

run clay all for a total forget your

hazards yeah it can be but this is

mostly what you'll see I mean you can

also use things like wish calm mind

Jirachi which is also a appreciative of

trap support and can keep you even more

healthy than we see uh yeah so salvia

Milotic also had the nice benefit of

having a total of 64 recovers between

them which is nice and longer games well

as long as your strategy isn't too

switched all the opponent to death

because it's like said that won't work

even though it'll take a million turns

but you get that so that that's that's

that's an example of the trap stuff the

cure trap stuff and you already saw a

subsidy so you can work on a horse

offensive scarm team you know or mag two

you know magnets car teet are like fan

men sir arrow I recognize that's not

quite accurate but you get the idea

speaking of offense and you know we're

gonna go to a fighting so become jolly

we'll say HP fighting more Shadow Ball

because we're not going to go over the

perfect optimization for whether this

team would prefer HP fighting her shadow

ball

generally I guess you would say Shadow

Ball just it's Gengar because of the

principle of earlier if T chars roared

and will still be threatening what

Gengar is one of the these things

biggest enemy so mad Snorlax and then

you put in yo maybe your Swampert maybe

Metagross maybe your salad or cross and

meds which can also DD I lacks because

it's good specially against things like

star me which these guys hate so and you

can throw in you know your track are

with DD you can throw in Gyarados

basically all your usual physical

suspects except in this case you've got

a Celebi that can help out against water

types so usually comments and

beneficiary event and make these guys

lot scarier this is gonna have agility

because as you can see Dugtrio is yeah

here so you really have to be very

careful you know so uh yeah don't worry

about this being quote-unquote walled by

a Zapdos because if you pass it swords

dance then me your max will cleave right

through it alright and this can be no

rest or be easily you know offensive as

Celebi or you want to smack that Gengar

put it in range for put bulky guard

range for hair cross and

deedy men's so Matadors can also run for

soup but on these kinds of teams but

with Celebi you're gonna abuse

rather than you know trap Gengar and

make everything perfect then you just

work with what you got this can even run

plumbery so and if Snorlax takes a hit

then it takes a hit but you know still

it things decently hard but as long as

the anchors on the picture then even

self-destruct while these chunk

something even went burned so maybe you

don't go all the way with Adam in but uh

you know you have to have a good chunk

here we're not really trying to defend

on this team all right so that's as deep

as and now we get to the most varied I

guess or the most hmm well this uh

actually you don't ignore that I'm sorry

all right so call mind Giga Drain hit

power fire and then either psychic or

baton Pat here is psychic so we are

going to start off with that the

traditional team that this would fit on

would be something think suicune

offensive duck trio remember Selby bait

duck trio don't you a traffic back and

now Tyranitar and jirachi

are happy this is something like Jabba

the Griffins old team and his old team

was this something let off it's yeah so

you know as you see teet are here bait

since unlink pert Celebi just the

offense going

you don't really want at some I mean a

lot of players will run this with like

Zapdos because they I still notice then

Skarmory can take a hit and with special

events you know get a spike up and roll

wind if it's a one-on-one with these

guys so Zapdos starts it off without

that being a problem it can also be Tom

pass into folk trio and you might also

be thinking well you know can sell the

baton pass here yes it hen as can Zapdos

so you can have a little combine chain

here for a little bit on pass chain yeah

so call mine you can run hydro is paid

or for things like comments weakness on

you know already gonna run HP grass

for safety they say that yeah so dog is

dog and this can be DD or whatever and

this is also offensive combined so you

can on men you can rely guys punch

because your sweepings offensive so your

so you don't want to give too much

leeway so however while this team does

not necessarily struggle with snow lags

that much because of tranch our sand and

leaning remember this house LV is

effective probably my scent making it

finished off a lot more easily than it

is without it it also applies to spring

code it also prizes that relax

so like the more traditional call mine

scheme which looks something like this

this is really gonna hate lacks like you

to is a new addition which is means that

you don't even necessarily have to run

don't true you don't even have to trap

the opposing dog trio with your own and

you also really don't even have to lock

it into HP bug you know if the vendors

raikou then you know p2 comes in and

we're cover stalls does that is optimal

because they can leave a nice beam so

and it's also nice because it counters

the heck out of nets

so Selby get some freedom there you got

to be careful of scarm of course but you

get the idea so this is that kind of

combine team I mean you can throw other

things in here but you get the gist this

is your you know pure call mind kind of

thing you can throw in Tyranitar here

and just say hey I'm gonna overwhelm

with just the special guys like if

you've got a patate like if you've got

rest sweet food and like offensive

breast is totally viable just for

sitting on Blissey and you know I'm

gonna baton pass with the Celebi things

like that but generally this is the pure

call mines now this isn't necessarily on

just Paul my team's I mean the teams I

just showed you they had three the four

call minders but it also fits in

teams with less so we're gonna look at

those now now the mixed offenses that

I've gone over in the Tran Itard

Salomon's videos you can refer to those

for a general idea of those bulky mostly

physical hitters it's mostly physical

guys or mixed physical in Swampert

Snorlax like baby Zapdos on the special

side because that bus is amazing but so

be also fits in those teams are often

brushed by duck trio and Selby helps

bake them in it works with heracross too

so you know you have things like this

but instead of going to draw Chi

sweetness right you got Metagross

Swampert and because you don't like

Skarmory that Zapdos comes in to help

out this is just an off the top of my

head you can also go things like

heracross this is a bad example because

the ground resists our cell being

heracross so something like flying on

would be deathly you got the general

idea like Salomon's can also Salomon's

can also appear I mean it doesn't have

to just be baiting Dugtrio it can it's

just the good offensive Pokemon and it

does the Zap it kind of does what's that

most acid and that it switches in toad

waters and it baits in like the salt

special wall for your big physical guys

to come in on no and if they don't have

that dedicated special wall then it can

very easily cleave through those beams

those spikes teams that sacrifice pure

defense for some more offense like for

example like we said earlier tea to our

scar garper and then you know throwing

like that dose and something basically

when there's not a bliss event it's

going to be really hard to wall

you just got to get it in offensively so

something like a mixed Tyranitar that

you know it's gonna prevent scarring

from spiking all over it and or even

something like a Tandy D tar that means

scar Mary's not the counter Swampert is

cell becomes in offense begins that kind

of thing you can throw your Zapdos isn't

here and that kind of thing and you can

run p2 and run Doug and yeah so yeah

Metagross is obviously another great

candidate for that kind of thing so I'm

just really throwing folks around here

but you get the idea

alright so I think that should curb

what Celebi does and advance on you why

it is good

ah yeah it's a recap and we're gonna

look at some crucial matchups Tyranitar

with defensive set the measure of the

sets i guess we've already kind of

covered these but go over the big ones

there aren't that many each our

defensive set then yeah they face off

quite a bit because tea park might even

swallow a leaf so you just to threaten

it out with HP bug if it's on the

physical side or crunch on this pickles

tonight um notable especially because it

can pursue however a baton past Celebi

has nothing to fear from pursuit so keep

that in mind

sometimes in a pinch you know you will

even see call my leach Celebi just not

being able to touch Teeter with an

attack which is call mining and leaching

and boosting and recovering in space not

be careful because you don't have a lot

of chances to get nasty crits and drops

but yeah it can't be done especially

nice if with spikes of course spikes

makes we've seen so much so much more

nasty you know 12% can be annoying

against teams without recovery like kind

of like these teams

imagine if there's no salvia and yes

which mean Elise it would be obnoxious

but get in a more prolonged game than

you want it to count so you want all the

games you can get even they uh you might

think well you know if he's gonna stall

out with leeches with pressure Zapdos

with rest and that's not good too much

well yeah you say that and then you

switch to your Turan tar on this but XF

those excuse me and suddenly the

Swampert is not as comfortable switching

into it

the Zapdos as partner Swampert is not

comfortable switching into France art

with spikes down that kind of thing uh

yeah

so trans hard offensive sets you can

blanket with you can blanket something

somebody has a long cool get really mad

HP grass I felt a lot of damage and even

is least he can never intentionally be

really bad but furniture generally tries

to coming out or recover if it can help

it

and offensive sets Giga Drain doesn't

quite kill but it's it going into a ton

after claw mind so you will outrun I

mean some players like to creep a little

under full key offensive cell abuse you

know the ones that hit yeah this number

they try to go a little higher for the

DD tar that hangs around this speeds

that ie hitting 301 is like a little

higher so Selby goes a little higher to

beat that but that scenario is rare

these days so you should probably count

on the DD tar that's trying to boost it

for face actually being outrun able to

outrun you after this one yeah Gengar oh

and we've already gone over the Baton

Pass thing with the sourcing Gengar is

annoying because Todd and Willow is and

to perfected Isis were fire punch and

with tanks that we played 30 Selby

doesn't hamper your soul counter if your

other pok√©mon are just totally destroyed

by it but it can help you ward it off

natural cure it has recovered and it has

stabbed psyche finger away I mean Ganga

is pretty menacing but you know when you

actually hit him then he becomes a lot

scarier so I mean sometimes if he's

brave or if it's really crucial that he

brings your Celebi down just so we can

spam birth plate with air attack doors

then yeah if you might go for a brave

time but otherwise no Metagross then so

especially defensive set goes a long way

bold set not something you really want

to go throw into it bunch of spikes down

but it is worth it's a good backup you

know it's it's not totally destroyed by

it something very important to note with

leaks uh be you gotta you gotta be wary

of how you're gonna play around scrub

you can't always fit in Makaton so

sometimes you're going to have to be

spammy recover a lot or leads to eaten

you know and recover just so because

otherwise you will be overwhelmed very

quickly so that's something to remember

but luckily you have 32 recovers so

you're not going to be burning through

it like saying Blissey wood with

soft-boiled

only got 16 I so if it's getting forced

to recover all the time then that's

really not good anyway uh yeah Metagross

we've got over leech and how the

defensive stats can pick it

reflect her pickup with HP fire can

annoy the death reflect even Saba can

get in its way and offensive sense

you're going to want to chip this thing

before I mean plus 1 HP fire does a lot

more than you think but it also doesn't

quite you know scare it to the point of

nearly being Oh code so you're gonna

want to do some damage to it luckily

something like Snorlax will fade it in

and you know focus punch it there you go

for the palm lines ya think that sums it

up Swampert we've gone over that

relationship with how sometimes it stays

and it tries to ice beam so I can the

answer on that now if you're an

offensive savvy sight you don't really

want to come into the even the defensive

says ice creams too many times because

that severely cuts into here damn into

your bulk you prefer to come in on

earthquake or ideally you come in on a

protect that's the ashes perfect but

yeah also worth mentioning that leaf

Celebi or defense will be Toby does a

good job at stalling out and never

stalker

about 32 recovers and endeavour and ice

beam combined are 24 so maybe don't burn

through all of them if you're gonna need

them but you know it's a very very solid

counter let's get very unlucky it's even

one freeze you know unless there's a

bunch of spikes on the field which yeah

sometimes it could be a problem but

usually you'll be able to dance around

it so that's very not well that's

something endeavor Swampert users have

to keep in mind

stop dose with spikes down and roar and

toxic in sometimes even HBIC can be very

obnoxious but generally Celebi in the

comments active before sometimes a pros

is a club in defensive tell me

ferns and it doesn't care my spikes so

against the baton pass variant then roar

Zapdos is also quite annoying but it

also takes damage that it's not healing

off without resting so that is worth

bearing in mind

Skarmory we've already gone over the

Magneton baton pass relationship for the

fence of HP fire alongside leads to a

tour the leech seed

we're the offensive coma HP fire thing

but generally you're going to want to

get out in front of the Scarberry and so

is one of the most ATV plays there is

let's see only really good for more than

like a turn if that against like the

pure offensive said because baton pass

will just turn it on its head other

swords dancer claw mind although Swords

Dance is usually easier to see coming

because of all the Magneton because of

the Magneton all the physical attacker

so you see a Saladin you know it's

happening there but um yeah then there's

uh the defensive sets which I mean they

can kind of stall leads but mo they also

give some you life activities it and

it's generally a nice place for Celebi

to heal up so but that's kind of a weird

I mean blis Wiz is one on one but it's

also not trying to be the one I want you

to toxic will suck but yeah that's a

weird one off that doesn't really come

to mind it's not really a match of bento

science game right and then and there

you know it's a place for both of the

kind of heels before they switch out

nobody on Selby is weird it's set

dependent so although I will say that

the defense of Celebi sets that make up

those really fat teams that try to auto

win you know with their mag claydol

Snorlax stuff then batad past Selby

excels shredding them suicune we've

already gone over defensive it's good

against defensive cool but not good

against offensive so sometimes you might

want to invest in some speed investment

which will also what and you'll still be

good against you'll still be good

against defensive sets found them when

needed and offensive sets are great

sweetener partners you know first the

special assault and they'll be helped

sweep it out again Zapdos yeah stuff

like that sometimes

meta doors booming on one can be a

blessing in disguise because music can't

boom on the other because it's her it's

common for its era like if they've got

Metagross in Planet Ark you've got a

call mine Celebi hurry and you've got

well

that a lot of that depends on sets I'm

sorry but the general idea is if they've

got a Metagross that can handle a plus

one hit from Selby and sweet food but

not both and your sweet movie might be

off there then it helps out the others

that was messy and disjointed I'm sorry

it's been out for a while oh yeah

jirachi same thing wish will stall out

leach eventually but with spikes down

mics are very crucial elite sieve not

just being a blob or a blob that's only

good in some matchups but you know with

spikes it's very annoying and taraji

doesn't I mean if it wishes either equal

PP deletes the effect and offensive sets

I mean yeah they work well together and

they don't really clash very much

it's drought she just kind of is faster

so it doesn't have to run a 30 speed IV

and isn't affected by sand so yeah

turtle acts Celebi is very off on the

defensive side it's often tasked with

switching into Snorlax professionally

useful because sometimes it's Sobeys

teammates Skarmory will get Magneton and

you don't want to be switching to rant

are and do a bunch of earthquakes or god

forbid a focus punch those Selby helps

there uh yeah so mixed sets hurricane

force alpha starstruck and blowing up on

it very often and reflects stops even

that I mean not after multiple curses

but mister one ie

you've pressured it to twenty words by

consent that where it's in danger of

going down from attacks then not going

to bother pepper doesn't think it's safe

enough to throw up several curses

that's a little specific we need to also

give Celebi back a ton of health which

is very useful oh yeah

well leech seed is your only strikes

countermeasure that you're going to be

in trouble so don't fall into that trap

and offensive sets offensive Selby likes

likes smell like sleeping I dealing

it's a pokey arrest set and in sand is

Celebes going to be similarly K owned by

lacks whereas sand helps let's go down a

lot quicker so yeah there's that

Salamence one of Selby's greatest

enemies psyche on the switch is good but

you know if it's coming in it's it's

probably pretty good

Thomas is often paired with some wish

Blissey just for being in bliss which in

a really threatened Celebi over and over

otherwise leech seed you know sell me

when's that the long term if it's got a

partner especially since its switching

like Swampert doesn't love taking a full

brunt of abandon HP flying but with Lee

she didn't do this so that's another

example of the importance of not coming

directly into lead sheet if you can help

it so yeah and offensive Celebi can

smack you with psychic maybe outrun it

but gotta be careful of the Jolly choice

band or so watch your sand turns and

yeah also a prime offensive partner if

it's SD passing to the dragon dancer

yeah duck trio graced I'll be partner

huge thorn on its side of a Selby can

either faded for dates or even survived

and take it out like the call mindset

the often ones if you run modest it's

also worth thinking about going really

stumped and it's investing in bulk be a

game changer if you your team cannot

afford to really go I mean if that's

going to be your Dugtrio magic not if

you can't afford to be better against

Dugtrio

I mean I guess that makes sense but it

that makes it sound more like I'm saying

well you know my team is my super

special perfect even just cannot afford

to be good against don't Rio which is

nonsense you've got to be good again so

it's or you know consider this as a way

of handling them better

star may bold Celebi did not play much

to keep its army if Mike's recurring

theme but the calm said I mean still not

ideal but it helps it will very often be

engaged in a Milotic like star war

against Celebes 16 attacking PP

temple strategy recovers but the threat

more in the credit or even worse the

freezes I mean it can handle a crit if

it's bulky enough its freeze that you

got to be worried about yeah because

then I can take out another Pokemon and

if they're spikes then it can be messy

things of that nature uh yeah

offensive been offensive since they

don't really have a much of a

relationship I mean so start me use ice

cream there's a lot more but Giga Drain

also heal Selby a lot back a lot and

after combine that Selby comes out on

top so Magneton great partner pretty

much it

clay at all sometimes a good partners

sometimes contributes to making the team

run over by offensive threats that the

team the big blob of a team neglected to

over

Skarmory being horrible to face I mean I

arrow is one of the things that likes to

switch in and scare Selby out against

offensive bomb line sets it's not

uncommon for it to swallow a hit

just so that I'll be just pick out

something else we should get into your

advantage because while arrows health

usually isn't crucial if you can make

that situation happen multiple times

easier to have been done but then

plunder will be on the ropes Jolteon not

much of a relationship I guess it you'll

be countering it because it usually runs

I mean even if it does run HP ice and

sell beats generally preferred as the

counter because you don't want

Swampert being roared out and so we can

heal up so roared out with spikes down

for the arrow or teat our partner I mean

so yeah Jovovich balance isn't that

strong so even if you are bold sob

you'll be able to take it heracross big

reason for the speed V's big reason and

psychic of course offensive sets

probably different story but yeah

heracross is one of the biggest threats

to those fat defense of course just

because of how brutally it absolutely

tears Celebi apart

Moltres is kind of like the physical

version of hair drawers

um doesn't care about spikes doesn't

really fear psychic so the only way

Selby really beats mulches is if it's

already by taking a hit I'll be it's

fast and fishes it off I mean if you

combine on the switch then Selby and are

faster than you can swallow a Fire Blast

generally not something you prefer to

happen of course mulch is definitely a

big threat big threat to most course

featuring Celebi almost defensive course

features Bobby because unless you got a

bliss even the Mets are very specific

ask is Selby sometimes steps on the

teams to provide Blissey like functions

in checking snarl of sweet kunin that

dose while also handling things like

Metagross and sore legs that bliss II

could never dream up it's a byproduct of

that down the road Milotic the defensive

sets kind of stall each other it's ice

cream hit Wayne Harmon is offered so you

got to be careful don't want to swallow

too many of those especially if you

offenses which you know to serve or

better yet recover and go to town but

yeah it's very worth mentioning Flygon

runs HP bug primarily because Selby is

annoying and the Jolly for attack set

the standard the old standard anyway

will be a thorn it's all beside however

Selby's massive natural bulk is often

enough to swallow one so if you really

need that damage on it for your tea tard

to clean up then it's up to you to make

that call

but yeah the timid versus golly is awful

keep an eye on your leftovers cloyce

you're not much of relationship hey

don't really see him that much together

quits Drew's more unlike mixed often

both those teams already strapped for

slots and then Selby kind of just makes

it flimsier against things like Snorlax

so you want to whereas Metagross and

company then they're more forceful

things to explosion

and greater overall bulk and just read

over our power as well part of the wall

yeah fortress big reason for HP fire

don't sometimes you'll see it on super

stalls sometimes really slow ones

together that's pretty much it I think

that relationship is spirits up it's

planetory especially with non-passing

Magneton auras ap fire P - not much your

relationship air those not what your

relationship except when carrados is

sweeping the plane and Selby's is one of

them great flying however when the

Gyarados is students celebi is the main

problems alright so thank you guys for

watching that is all for today I hope

this was helpful I hope you take

something from this and yeah Celebi is

really good in advance here one of the

most crucial Pokemon in the metagame and

you should keep it in mind when build

earrings iris pouting cliches at this

point but uh yeah thank you guys and I

will catch you next time
