a TV on your Salamence what does it do

doesn't do things let's find out

so the first thing that might pop out at

you are salamence is i popping offensive

stats its attack is tied for the highest

in oh you with Metagross since

technically slacking is BL and also not

that good but it's also got a meaty

special attack in a great speed tier its

bulk is not to be underestimated as we

will see later and intimidate has been

called the best ability in the game to

go along sides

um typing that has you know it's sharing

weaknesses and resistances like

everything else but it's which

weaknesses and resists it possesses that

helped shape its place in the middle

game let's begin by looking at where

Salomon's falls on the handy dandy

viability rankings then we will examine

its sets and then we will use may uh

examine its comma interactions it's most

common most important interactions with

other pokemon in the meta game finally

we'll wrap up by looking at some

examples of teams that Salomon's falls

on so let's begin elements is here in a

- rank which i think is fair asus ranch

army stands above everyone else

these guys are enormous game changers

these guys the a rank they are up there

like seriously up there but just a

little lower and a - rank is don't sleep

on these guys these are defining threats

I mean this is some serious company

Solomon says but uh they've got some

more things holding them back than the

others and I think that's fair whereas

here we start getting into kind of the

same idea but less overall defensive use

and I think the offensive defensive

aspect of offensive Pokemon in the

earlier generations is open up this way

you see a lot less glass cannons because

you need to double down on off or on

defense as well

and the damage output isn't usually

worth completely losing a slot of

defensive utility toward and so that's

why you see no none of these guys are

defensively useless at all it's just

that they are more defensively limited

in addition to their roles so Sal events

has offensive defensive purpose but in

due time so we will begin with the

dragon dance set now you might be

thinking wow well there's no choice

scarf and Salamence is fast meaning that

nothing is naturally going out speed it

after a dance except like ninjask and

deoxys speed so it's probably you know

the best set by far right I mean it's a

good set one thing about Salomon's is

that it is prone to the variability of

player opinion for example some people

think Salomon's is just unbelievably

good really up there with the peanuts of

the tier and just totally unstoppable

others cite its weaknesses and I suppose

it's not as intuitive to use as some

other Pokemon it's not quite as plug-in

in many matchups and that is what leads

others to say that it's you know average

or barely above average but let's take a

look so dragon dance is a fierce sweeper

it always runs leftovers because getting

killed by sand is stupid and it also

lets it have opportunities to work

defensively against things like

heracross and Celebi those are its two

big defensive targets those are some big

Pokemon to cover other Pokemon it

doesn't really explicitly check that

well but it definitely plays a pivoting

which again big part of advanced how you

and it's going to and that's how it will

function against those it's also how

some teams dance around it it's a

beautiful it's vortex of out playing the

other guy and making the most of your

tools when hard countering things is not

in

equation as most teams and settlements

experience because it is more on the

offensive side than a wall for the most

part anyway so dragon dance is a fear

sweeper leftovers it will always have

these moves reason why it always has

rockslide is because think of the

Gyarados example if caravans ran rocks

LA it could learn rockslide it would

always use it being walled by Zapdos and

Aerodactyl is terrible and especially

sin and that's why sometimes it runs

Valley HP rock that gives up HP flying

for that Menace doesn't have to do that

it runs rock always it will always

run an adamant nature always jolly DD

Matz is dumb and its speed can vary you

know you might just say max speed and

maybe with even 31 speed IV spread for

HP flying but since most immense are

going for the DD then they want the bulk

to get that DD and coz after they can

continue their sweep so it's safer bet

twist when there gonna be someone down

this is the magic numbers this is Adam

inherit rocks

so now as we'll revisit throughout this

video then jolly heracross sometimes

pops up for things like that ments that

this heat as well as offensive Zapdos

but it's also not really that great

because mets can very easily just run

you know max speed and you know here's

jolly hara and it's like well I gave up

very little to make you even weaker

against me that you already are so I

personally think the payoff of jolly

heracross is fishing and unnecessary but

that's just my opinion

anyway and then it will run from max

attack you know so the rest in HP so you

take both heracross megahorn z' and

rockslides and Celebi sightings and

things like Jirachi psychic if there's

no ice punch and yeah it's strong

and then there's the other option of

taking some out of attack and investing

purely in special offense I believe this

is something resembling the spread

I personally uh well we'll get to why I

don't think this is the greatest spread

in a minute but yeah this is the spread

meant to survive weaker ice beams from

defensive Swampert and defensive suite

hood and milotic as well since Salamence

is physical sets have the bulky water as

it's well known enemy now you might

think hey why is rocks for earthquake

and automatic entry on this set and good

call it is the standard by far

however some teams replace it with brick

rate why you might ask

well max HP Tyranitar can survive even a

plus-one earthquake and that stands in

the way of a lot of teams that stands in

the way of a lot of men's sweeps another

check that you would never think is a

check but is is Blissey Palissy does not

care if you're especially defensive in

sand it will wipe you out with modest

Mac's special attack ice beam which it

runs for Dugtrio so instead some people

like to say you know what I'm just gonna

max attack it doesn't kill Blissey does

99 percent max but if you put any sort

of damage on it you probably in the

clear and Lisi is a Pokemon that is

commonly lured in but we'll get to that

later on when we speak about the teams

so Brick Break is also an option verb

Lisi and her aunt are however there are

these guys Metagross and Jirachi and you

might think well you know giving a

coverage on them that really sucks

but that is what magnet on one of

Salomon's is best friends is for

physical variants of men's hates

farmerie they love magnet on later but

it definitely helps a lot and here

Magneton takes on the role of

eliminating jirachi and Metagross you

can also try other ways like baiting

Metagross of the terrain this one using

dunk trio things like that and also

generally they this ideally baits in the

teet are before it baits in the rocchi

so poor is it still not ideal but

something to keep in mind anyway I don't

want to give too much attention to Brick

Break since it isn't the more nice

choice by and large earthquake is the is

the standard choice for a reason yeah so

that's didi mince hates bulky waters

likes Magneton is a hates Carm sometimes

comes up short against bulkier teams

since even once the water is removed its

bulky teat are this it's listy bat and

even bulky Gengar very often runs a

spread of 248 HP and 44 defense which

allows it to always live a plus 1 HP

flying so you can't get that semblance

of damage on it then that's you know

it's that's another check so that's why

some people say well you know even if

you take out the so called counter then

there are three more checks waiting for

it which is a fair criticism but we will

get to why beauty mints is a fearsome

sweeper you must respect later on so

that's generally you won't use this

men's to wall break very much because

you're gonna do your 40% of per and die

and then you know off you go

then it protects outta range and it's

basically like you lost your comments

it's definitely more of an endgame

cleaner early game if you use to pivot

around HP grasses and earthquakes then

fine but it is generally not advised to

go for an early game unless you've

scouted their team a little and you know

that they're looking a little fragile

against men's and that

can pick up the pieces after that's very

important you're not going to win very

many games by just throwing medicine

there dding and sweeping I mean sure you

might occasionally get that to happen

but that's just the nature of Pokemon

sometimes it works play if you want to

be consistent with it you have to have

it planned out and I think that is why

there's a reason why some people detract

from didi meds when it's I mean the

criticisms are definitely valid but if

you are conscientious of its issues when

you make your team and when you play the

game then I mean it's one of the

scariest Pokemon in the meta game and if

you sleep on settlements any set it has

a habit of being absolutely unforgiving

it punishes teams that slack off on

coverage really really hard but how am i

doing in the bar sorry about that um

yeah so I think that's that covers it

all so menses is good even if you know

it's coming but it's mark of a good

Pokemon but I felt that necessary to say

moving on choice bandar Chris Bandar is

pretty you know max attack is pretty

much a given

and the traditional set is max max

adamant no no nonsense

you can also do with the banks or with

the D deers that does and go down and

get the bulk out of it that's viable too

especially it's tell me get some

defensive use so moves are no nonsense

the last couple months all right so the

traditional set was Fire Blast last even

without of it nature but you know

nowadays scarm runs HP arad runs careful

with millions per debt so I wouldn't

really recommend that the standard buy

it large now is brick break because of

that cold

okö on t tar this is why if you have a

leak notes against a lead teacher you

need need need to switch out if you are

the teacher guide because you might

think oh I live

like adjust brick race you and their

there goes TT are the extra hit on

Snorlax and Blissey is also enormous

other than that you know the coverage

speaks for itself

pretty much everything really hard brick

break also has the tangible benefit of

slamming the heck out of porygon - who

is a really surprisingly tough to take

down men's check but for its other sets

HP flying with spikes down and sand also

does quite well but brick break by

itself just smacks p - moving on uh

sound this is the same I mean it hates

mag but it smacks the waters really hard

just initially so you can kind of get in

and threaten things a lot harder even

things like Celebi would believe seen on

tv' meds definitely not quite as safe of

course it's more prediction airline um

things would protect kind of annoying it

like Swampert Karachi's at those

defensive teams losing health and sand

really sucks of course it has excellent

synergy with Jirachi

and Blissey when they're carrying wish

so that's not as big an issue but worth

noting and it is vulnerable to getting

pursued in by Tyranitar if it lands Nate

flying but that's still it's still a

pretty risky move to send guitar right

into right into meds something notable

about settlements that not a lot of

players are aware of is that if you are

not facing a Skarmory if you're facing a

more offensive team that hinders that

hinges on things like teat are the steel

as a notch of your Metagross and then

the water then since even if they have a

gengar it's probably not coming in then

it's often a valid go for earthquakes

because you're gonna hit the water

basically as hard as HP flying it's five

BP a difference

and you're also going to spec a huge

return if you hit guitar or the steel so

the only thing that might get in the way

of that is Zapdos pizzette dose isn't

exactly risk-free either since katana

offensive team like that HP flying

itself will sting it and then that can

lead to complications later

Zapdos often anchors those teams against

scary things like Gengar and darby

basically what I'm saying is like DD

vents banned me you need to be

conscientious of how you use to use it

you need to plan each hit like if you

hit the T tar with HP flying you're like

all right well I can handle that because

I can wish to it later and I want damage

on teeth bar form I call my jirachi

sleep not too sweet stuff like that I'll

definitely require some game planning

although it is definitely more prone

well I don't know it's it's prone to you

know kind of letting you autopilot a

little just by virtue of some teams

getting completely hammered by it and

but DD he also has that since some

frailer offensive teams kind of skimp on

the coverages we'll see you later

anyway uh yeah that's band bends for you

Mike DD but not okay so mixed here is

probably the easiest to use Salomon set

good on pretty much pretty often or even

more balanced spike team this thing is a

terror it doesn't take any nonsense from

the physical walls armory and Swampert

and it also does not easily bend to the

special wall Blissey because of brick

great especially in sandstorm which

makes blitz see even if it's not a

Tuakau which it usually won't be with

the spikes then you're forcing a

soft-boiled which one wastes PP in a

longer game and to gives you a safe

switch to whatever your Lisi switches

for example it's if you switch to your

full key focus punch Tyranitar on the

soft boil rather than eating a potential

toxic or whatever then that's really

really nice

so oh sorry I was about to mention the

speed it is also viable for men to run

jolly on choice man power difference is

noticeable I won't lie there and it

really depends on how your team can

handle the threats that jolly is meant

to deal with the back and dance

Tyranitar though nowadays with so many

trans high running max speed then this

becomes less useful but another option

another viable use is offensive Celebi

and offensive Raj you're only going to

tie Jirachi but you know with with how

some that mine spines and cellphone not

really having the backbone to stand up

against it then sometimes it's better

than up and you're always going to

outspeed offensive Celebi because they

were an HP fire and let's drop their

speed IV and you'll also outrun Moltres

be really annoying so that's what jolly

is used for however and admin is so mix

kind of the same deal there speed wise

although when you're trying to make

every percent count against your in

protecting combo of Skarmory and

Swampert then the standard remains fresh

yeah so I mean some people actually it's

quite rare for men to go down so this

range and get some more attack in there

which I mean I think it's good because

more punch against ATAR bliss ease

Snorlax is game-changing but yeah it's

pretty self-explanatory you pretty much

put together then delete it greatly and

you start scoring the ranges locked into

things for example Metagross is scared

of banned mints but bandmates lock into

an attack it's not quite as scared of DD

mints but mixed mix threatens if from it

really high range and doesn't have to

lock in and even if you pivot into the

fire blast with your Swampert then

suddenly HP grass is a problem and then

comes the common

common dilemma of HP grassing into his

Aptos or a gang car but yeah those are

the offensive checks the standard last

move is Dragon Claw just a powerful stab

hits other men's really hard

Flygon is also a big one just a nice

stab attack oh wow because it also

really names Gengar on the switch if

water pivots in it's not being

completely unscathed it helps to if you

I think that this the mixed Salomon set

it has really huge potential upside if

you play aggressively with it because

it's already like tough to play around

when you're pivoting around it but if

the guy you know plays kind of ahead and

instead of fire blasting your Metagross

as you switch to Swampert so you don't

have to snap those finger into a Fire

Blast if he just goes right for the HP

grass I mean it definitely takes a

certain degree of bravery but it's it

can be well worth because the advantages

are they're huge so yeah I can also run

naive just gonna mention that now but

some people like that because as dose

gets faster and so the calm eyes

creepers are always present and that hit

his big against really offensive teams

but the don't get fooled into just

thinking well I want my stuff to be fast

because I mean there's definitely um

there's definitely value in that there's

no doubt about that but do not

underestimate what just how tangible the

benefits of the extra damage can be you

know if you just want to hang out the

damage count for a while and learn those

that that goes a long way where the

difference is of what you can and cannot

afford another wave that sometimes

replaces Dragon Claw is rockslide but

especially defensive Zapdos is annoying

now while forcing it the ref is pretty

good sometimes you want immediate snack

on it maybe you really you're trying to

support your suicune or something

some some teams crumble if Zapdos can't

handle it so just got to be careful with

fire blasts PPE against things like next

farm range rock ski flamethrower is

really not that strong

I mean it's viable it is but you got to

be careful again playing playing really

heads-up will really throw a wrench in

their plan because seems very often

danced around this set by the skin of

their teeth and by you know HP grassing

on a very obvious protect and now that

guy's like well now I didn't even waste

a fire blast not fire blasting into

specially defensive Zapdos as it wastes

your two of your fire blasts for the

price of one is also good

yeah so that's mixed meds a staple on

many many offensive teams in the current

pay for it's often depends the value and

its ability to pressure just about

hippie it really hates Milotic like it

really really hates Milotic you guys

it's used because Milotic prevents it

from really doing any sort of damage so

that is something to keep in mind I

believe that is most of what really

needs to be said for mixed nuts so these

three are the main med sets

dd band mix but we're also gonna mention

wish because it's worth mentioning oh I

also forgot to mention which is also

viable on on mix meds either

/ HP grass or over Brick Break depending

on how you want to play if you're cool

with being wall my bliss knee but you

just want to heal up your meta dress and

t2 are all day that's cool your if you

got other things for Swampert and and

then uh you know this is cool too so

which is it's an off it's not meant to

be a wall it's just meant hey I have a

free turn and I'm probably not gonna do

that much damage so I'm gonna play it

safe and I'm gonna throw up a wish and

then that'll keep my team healthy which

is important because longevity can be

hard to come by on these offensive teams

and the teams that you're trying to

break are often very

that really suffocated you which goes a

long way in that effort

anyway ask for more dedicated wish sets

then they make use of Salomon's is

impressive bulk with intimidate and

we're just gonna go well the classic set

is this because flamethrower roasts

anything that is new to toxic so Steel's

and venusaur so I know you anyway and so

that's it's pretty classic I mean it

takes very little from lots of physical

attacks like let's take a look here

we're gonna check off intimidate that is

I'm not saying

salmon's becomes a narrow diagonal

counter but that can be pretty good so

yeah that's a classic set and another

thing that some people like to do is run

on magnet on teams like bulky magnet on

teams then they like to run him powered

flying the Scarb is no longer a factor

they'll deal with Metagross some other

way and HP flying is nice for dealing

with Celebi because sometimes against

like a really a bulkier had a left overs

SD Hera frost and the slower

mence can lose because flamethrower is

only a two ação so this is the no

nonsense from hair crossing anyway wish

menses is quite rare as a dedicated

Wishman I mean wishing on mix isn't very

common either but this is just for the

sake of completion anyway these are the

big guns

so now let's jump into its interactions

with the other Pokemon here the notable

ones Tyranitar it got over bulky sets

and cleave a hit from the dragon dancer

at +1 why Brick Break is you sometimes

and choice pain sometimes gets pursued

by it yeah that's I think that's about

it

sometimes teat are is willing to trade

pretty much all its health just if it's

running a box liner ice beam on a bulky

set the pivoted to immense fire blast

and then stays in and goes for the

attack even what what choose a really

strong Brick Break so if you're going to

make that move then you better have

better have a plan for taking advantage

of it than that you know try again later

so again for see how your opponent is

going to try and dance around your mats

and going one step ahead can be huge and

I mean it's seen it seems daunting at

first so does every every brave

prediction but it's I mean man sir you

gotta play heads-up with it to get the

most value out of it the closest you're

gonna come is you know a guy really

autopilot victory and the year I could

do it for sheer power you're gonna do it

with usually the choice may end up

sometimes but the closest you'll get

most of the time is just mixed bring

people on the back foot and if you can

predict that all right well he needs

this guy so I'm just gonna predict his

sacrifice you can dance behind device up

creating a guitar for it then that goes

a really long way really steps on your

opponent's throat on the other side

salamence coming the teet are is mostly

either pretty good HP grasses from

Swampert

so then you scare it out with your

strong brick break the now rarer

instance of men's being jolly and liking

DD tar adam bulky adamandeva tart and

even if it's not jolly

then salamence sometimes goes with just

you know switching in on earthquake or

whatever and then back out just for the

intimidate spam cuz intimidate is really

valuable yeah so in guard

Gengar

it's pretty much the bulky set is the

only thing that really is physically

with talent like defensively as it more

than offensive revenge killing role like

offensive set is one of the scariest to

plays that scarcely nice to deal with

because guys coverage and Tasker at that

meeting Harmon priests which were Gengar

terrible but the bulky set lives in HP

flying and that's why some you're gonna

want to ship it even a little you don't

even have to like kill it with pursue

which is why some players to Metagross

with it it's not even about killing it

it's about this lady badly smallest of

percents and then it drops so yeah

there's that and then there's game guard

pivoting in to mix up against a guy

who's really pressuring with his mix men

sometimes they're even gonna like an

actual hit as in Dragon Claw Fire Blast

which are equally powerful so and it can

take one of those in sand but generally

it prefers to come in on brickbreaker HP

grass which I hope to not go for I mean

it's it's hard to not use HP grass again

Swampert you really needed dead but you

know you got to remember hey I've got a

teat are you can't just throw just heard

away things like that so Gengar is uh

you'll notice a trend but like against

the mix against mixed mints a lot of

teams are gonna be like well I'm gonna

have to dance around it except those

with my luggage and chorion too even if

there's a bunch of spike anyway at least

those teams can respond by walling the

wall which is generally safer than going

with more fragile offense against

Pokemon that specialize in hitting the

frailer offensive Pokemon that can

threaten them really hard so that was a

bit of a tangent but that's that's

Gengar for you now we're gonna separate

Metagross and karate in their own sector

so we're gonna come back to that

Swampert of course the DD check

something worth noting is the frailer

Swampert epidemic loop we'll get to that

when we get to the team section right uh

it pivots and pivots out of

it's out of the mix set and something's

worth noting that even defensive

swampers sometimes don't and but even if

you do even if you're max man very few

then if it's your only switch to see bhp

flying then or you know even that hick

and really stink even with just one

spike

if men's is on one of those teams but

it's devastating so you're going to want

to have some alternative ways of dealing

with those HP finds Zapdos Zac dose is

it's weird it's not really a men's check

but you would think of like oh yeah this

checks elements but it's demonstrating

tell feds yeah this is kind of pretty

good at checking men's or at the very

least it's great at relieving pressure

off your main men's check because men's

usually aims for them not for Zapdos

because that dose is usually not seen as

the most threatening thing in the world

for meds so you don't really think about

it those kind of switches can be really

effective bathing on dangerous Pokemon I

think it's starting to change I think

people are starting to realize okay this

is the Zapdos thing if I actually switch

into my men's I might want to account

for that

so yeah the offensive sets if they're

running timid in HP eyes and they're one

of the best mixed punishment oh you know

you don't want to switch into several

dragon claws obviously but uh you know

the model sets then they usually run HP

grass too so I mean now that they care

and HP is they just usually run HP your

ass so it's more Thierry but it's also

scary because it's under wave and you

know that's men's pretty much out of the

game other than like a dying intimidate

again intimidate is really amazing the

special offensive set is known for being

able to we're off mix books pretty well

a little bit sports to rest and you take

advantage of and you can be overwhelmed

with a combination like CB Metagross and

men's you know ganging up on it and

suddenly it feels like it's got too much

and that's what the wounds

womper has to get involved at the Petar

will go down that up that a pyramid

crumbling thing later anyway so Zapdos

is kind of a kind of a pretty good men's

check but also not quite that good

remember max HP ten with a plus one

rockslide by you know not something

really count on its it's a good

last-ditch effort

Skarmory pretty simple mixed um mixed

rise a fire blast it

ideally does not eat a toxic you know if

scar me doesn't have spikes down that's

a good way of making it tubes and really

hammering that damage onto it and also

making sure you have a way of the oh oh

now that his scarves dead or dead or uh

now that scarf is really weak then my

Metagross becomes more dangerous and

therefore i can enact my office again

the heads up stuff i mean you can

autopilot but you will not be as

successful as if you thought it out yeah

and for the physical sets you you pretty

much you blow them up with like a

Metagross or a curse boom lacks or you

maggot on it or you just have pressure

coming from every direction next to it's

hard

offensive Swampert focus punch lacks

like that

that you know shouldn't be you know

against your standard tar scarm

pert Gengar Blissey team with whatever

filler the filler usually because it's

like star me or duck shia or air dactyl

so i'm post DD mints anyway it's like

what like you know scar and then I blow

up the perk and he's guitar guitar and

Blissey so it's kind of like the whole

theme checks that's where you know

things like a chipping Gengar and Rick

Rick men's come in but yeah bliss II can

be kind of going but at the same time

you're not going to get by with Blissey

as a meds counter at all I mean because

even switching into the mix set you know

forces the soft boil that we've already

gone over how that can be turned to the

meds

users advantage quite easily so and of

course choice bandits it destroys it so

uh yeah

Celebi Celebi is a big one because this

is one of the pokémon that Salomon's

truly let's not say hard counters

because adamant because if the adamant

or the the neutral speed variance fall

to a certain range then be it offensive

Celebi sets with psychic Africa mine

might be able to take it out but yeah

for the most part Salomon scarce I mean

no it's a defensive call mind variant

with leech and it's like a mixed

elements but that should be able to you

should be able to dance around that with

your other Pokemon so it's not as much

of an immediate offensive threat and in

terms of scary on like the leach

experience the physical sets are

fantastic at it I mean you don't want to

switch into it and not do anything back

out the entire time you're gonna want to

plan how you're going to get around that

defensive core with both your team and

now you're going to play it in the game

we have salamence is tasked with going

with Celebi like often and that's why

wish bliss of you is really good because

sometimes we'll try to fall back on

their Celebi or quite often people try

to fall back on their Shelby because

Blissey would spread status and bullying

damage to their other Pokemon throw up a

wish fences in men's is healthy yeah

it's hangouts fair and of course the

jolly man said it's good for making sure

the often variants don't get up to any

nonsense just gotta be careful and I

think that's the beauty of advance both

of them I mean men's has a banjo or

Selby fella became is advantage most of

it depends on how you play and if your

heads up with your team as well of

course if you know you have five Pokemon

destroyed by Celebi and a salamence

you're flying on Queen it anywhere but

yeah that's uh I think that's great yeah

mence is one of them

Bobby is one of the Pokemon that men's

truly truly helps deal with safely and

more safely than others suicune what are

the horrible horrible bulky waters that

get in the way of Phoebe menses sweep of

course this horrible horrible bulky

water gets tasked with dealing with

things like Metagross that learn

explosions that often happens and it's

it's more resilient to choice ban

assault because of how astronomically

bulky it is but with sand affecting it

then that can also be its downfall

so it'll usually get forced into

arresting boku-kun doesn't always run

ice cream they tend to run roar so

that's isn't quite as definitely afraid

and mix variances are pretty much it's

not really a good mix very dancer

although weight is a big either uh how

do I say this

well okay so with the popularity of

offensive suicune on offensive teams

then they can be prone to getting

overrun by men's just because of how I

mean Sweigart is still really bulky

naturally but without the investment

that you really start to see menses

power shine through so I think that sums

it up and those are the ones that

actually run ice beam so trade offs it's

just that uh I mean not that bold ice

cream suicune is bad it's just that roar

helps did not get totally destroyed by

other suicune so it's a big one and it

also have some things like personal

accent just general safety like roaring

away a DD tar so you don't have to hit

two serbs on it in a pinch or a coal

miner on it's another big one or even

though offensive comments elevate you

know giga drain isn't anyway um we are

saving dry food for later and we have

Snorlax next relax and men's I mean they

mostly interact with Snorlax surviving a

DD men's assault and blowing up on an

offensive team um because if it's a

defensive Chris parents just got to pray

for the body slam

boys I mean display like this one like

this partisan process it's horrible

but you've got a you've got a if you

switch on like shadow ball or fire blast

earthquake or something then you can

scare it out with the choice man the

salt and the mixed set scotch is one of

the Pokemon offensive teams that

decently pivots into most of mixed

menses attacks three out of the four so

as long as your brick break I'd be

brittle only three ako but that's really

big damage you can make a difference

because you know you brick race again

suddenly Zapdos is gonna it's in your

sponsors in Zappos right so mint salt

mint that's an interesting one the most

obvious that you might think of is Mets

intimidating the other Mets to stop a DD

sweep and that happens yeah um what else

I mean band sets don't really collide

mix it's kind of you know kind of play

chicken and that you you don't really

want to do it the most you'll see it's

like one might pivot into the other so

that brick break to be through or

something or yeah I think that's pretty

much it that's another reason why naive

salamence is big dumb trio mens don't

really have any special relationship I

mean Rick break sets might appreciate

bug trio alongside magnet on to really

assist in getting rid of Metagross inter

re I think that's pretty much about it

yeah I mean okay I guess a a big one is

when you have a physical offensive team

that doesn't really have like one of the

ways of handling Dugtrio is by really

punishing if we're getting a KO and one

of the most vicious ways of punishing

that ko you know when it's like an

earthquake and it gets that Dedes

poop you know yeah so there is little

there's nothing quite like the feeling

of helplessness

when Salomon's dragon dances everything

is out running out code

the most common occurrence but it can be

made of reality if you really know what

you're doing

so um yeah star me starving is the worst

because the off so allow the offensive

teams that sell bits finds itself on

they hate tournament because it's just

things that Oh cones left and right meds

teat are Gyarados and then things like

Metagross which have to kill they have

to kill themselves with explosion they

get to even take it out and Hydra still

does a ton and like latch so gets worn

down his fan and heard who's just kind

of like well what I have to care a

counter star me now - are you serious so

yeah but star me gets obliterated after

a DD and it also really struggles to

switch into meds so there's that

starving it's more about a mess without

a DD now things start to die I in the

field especially the hydro pumps on the

switch could not easily let go of that

men's anyway so yeah Star me is a hated

enemy but if you play your cards right

it can also be a victim of a DD sweep

also comes in like it's even coming in

on mixed variances like yeah Urmi is

terrible defensively with an offensive

test if there's that Magneton Salomon's

his best friend a physical that

sometimes you would you know more so you

don't use it but Magneton just makes

life so much it's nice when you don't

have to blow up your Metagross on

Skarmory because magnetrons already

killed it yes and if Swampert is the one

fighting that arrow so you blow that up

so how those teams function as we'll see

played all sometimes an annoying

emergency check who TV ments with the

ice beam or explosion but not really any

sort of prolonged counter I mean yeah if

it pivots into Brick Break from a mixed

step and that's annoying but and I mean

it's resistances have the potential to

be an obnoxious but it's not really good

at handling mints per se more assists in

the effort kind of like Zapdos is that

justice really in the men's counter in

most cases boring stupid f vs mix but

it's got the resist to make it easier to

play around since it does inspire some

degree of fear of men's

yeah it's similar Aerodactyl Aerodactyl

sometimes we'll just have to pivot into

the mix set once maybe even twice they

can do so once risk-free but the second

time you know you gotta come in on the

grass I deal with the fire blast

anything the fire bus misses oh yeah

it'll scare out and DVD bends but uh

like duck trio lock into the wrong place

that might be game over mence really

punishes the wrong choice lock because

of its speed making it impossible to be

like well you know okay I sack the one

thing that prevented you from getting a

second Dee Dee and now I'm back like for

example don't trio lacking into aerial

ace to kill heracross feeding time well

I'm gonna know Dee Dee up now and then

they sack like a Metagross or something

or maybe they don't even second let's

let's take an example of like um focus

punch Snorlax but it's like all right

well I'm gonna sack this thing goes back

in there you go Ramez doesn't really

allow for that which is part of what

makes it so scary

yeah Jolteon don't an immense no really

don't a little pivot into mix sometimes

and scare out cuz Jolteon the ice most

of the ways even if it's HP flying is

just a bunch in DD

right

as injustice Prezi so without another

one of the without a TV story yes and

dad doesn't really switch into it well

at all I doesn't resist any of mixes

attacks so especially the spikes which

makes men's is one of the best abusers

of all right heracross here's another

Pokemon that Salomon's has a special

relationship with as it is one of the

few check specific and the fighting

moves and has intimidated which is just

huge absolutely enormous and it's got

good bulk good natural bulk you know

let's let's not say good let's say above

average

thanks to intimidate of course it

doesn't want to take a look the band

heracross megahorn or even worse Rock

Slide

but it is one of the few things that you

can really just from what turn switching

it prompts and be like okay threat you

know maybe I'm completely a virgin but

threat slowed down yes so that's a

that's a very big one you gotta be

careful para cross and I think that

these dynamics of how immense works with

other Pokemon is a great example of how

advanced works as a whole you know

thanks things kind of encounter each

other but they might not counter each

other but it's not hey I'm gonna whip

out my 500 secret coverage move you

can't possibly be ready for like hey I'm

going to play my way into making this an

issue for you

so never cross can definitely be a thorn

in menses side especially if it's like

if there's no sand and there's a salad

berry set and mints is taking a hit

before then you know a sub down to south

that dance up you plus one now you're

doing frantic and few minutes to kind of

not get swept well yeah that's uh but

for the most part mence gives you a

sense of security against her across and

it is for the most part accurate you

can't really sit on you your thumbs with

thinking ah well you know even if I let

it here across 15 times I'll be okay

because that demands more like that but

it's so it it gives you like a really

good switch in a couple times and

sometimes that's all you need this if

you

offensive team you're not stretch it

became that anyway there's hair crosses

team which is also gonna be offensive

which also means - means itself so good

stuff very good stuff

Moltres human Moltres is more more

popular doesn't really running guys with

a rescuing Swampert is a huge deal but

will-o'-wisp kinda ruins mints a lot is

the least ruined by it and drag cloud

will still found it a few sets with

rockslide well especially if they're

plus B then it's not really that you

saying with toys

yeah this is pretty much a plus B versus

non plus a big thing of course mulch is

absolutely crushed after a dance but

yeah I can be a will just can mess teams

up and men's doesn't really like facing

off with it the most scary is like if it

pivots into a multi HP grass and has

rockslide even that's scary because

mulch is go for a willow Asst we can

Swampert knowing it's not gonna stay in

so yeah another interesting dynamic of

how you know we can go a certain way and

or might go another way depending on how

the players play um big ones here's

where we end my loading salamence is

work okay usually somewhere centimeters

if I can't dance it is pretty much never

getting vibe that's where you have your

Metagross I've made it in after bongos I

picked it even if I just as much with my

loading but you bait it in somehow and

you have to have a plan to deal with it

otherwise it's just going to

unforgivingly

while you and kill you as soon as you

leave Munson on it you know once your

plan is to CD and switch to put I'm

Zapdos and have it use ice beam eight

times that would be funny but yeah

realistically Milotic is the worst it's

physical its own is not that good which

means that it can take DD mints but

banned horses recover

now this isn't that bad itself because

as we'll see here

never even brakes 50 but with spikes

down you know and sand obviously

actually the spiked thing doesn't only

the same thing really works yeah as you

can see with spikes and sand involved

this is this is absolutely this is

incredibly dangerous and even earthquake

is not far behind with spikes and sand

it's comfortable but that's really for

preventing dumb things like magnet on

switching into HP flying happen which

happens more than you think is you know

menses inspires hear you well you know I

got a figure out a way to dance around

this so similar Rita

Zapdos switching into it do prevented

from getting miss then magnetized events

comes into a being flying like roof well

you know kept away from my Milotic thank

goodness so yeah that's a big one of

course mixed berries that usually plan

most things

Milotic is like the worst you and you

really gotta have a plan to abuse it

because I believe I mentioned earlier

then Milotic if you do if your team does

not have longevity then Milotic afford

it it worked face about 30 to PP or

coverage just horrible anyway I believe

that is that is inaccurate or sub

summation on the mix offensive teams and

we'll see like um yeah he relaxed is

pretty reliable because it can't be

toxic thanks to immunity but that dose

you've really got to force that remember

you gotta each be grass that switch

still does nothing I mean it's Hellenic

is so bulky in this inside and I think

it ties into another reason why advance

feels so balanced the Pokemon have huge

you know offensive stats but the base

power on the moves is not that monstrous

so so flag on flag on Mets is actually a

common flag on switch it hates toxic

obviously it doesn't love take rocks

points but you know when it comes to

soaking up earthquakes and threatening

in return

it's mixed obviously threatens Flygon

like heck um and when it gives up Dragon

Claw on the big sets I mean you could

still rock slide men's I mean it's not

the same like you can still haven't

moved to hit it but you become

completely walled by Flygon I mean I

guess that I'm like the vocalist Flygon

sense they still don't really appreciate

they don't really appreciate these hits

repeatedly but it's worth mentioning

that flying on becomes more of an issue

because you think well you know flygon's

not really an issue for men and then

suddenly it actually presents somewhat

of a roadblock so it throws you off

pairs well with ice beam t tar since i

think two times best flag on the word

the tear so uh yeah I think that's

pretty much it medicine flag on man

certainly has the upper hand

yeah it doesn't want to eat and if it's

frailer it doesn't want to I think that

generally doesn't want to eat repeated

rock slides no matter what unless it's

um bulky wish variant or just the

offensive push grade to those little

scare flag I know um yeah

mence really has the advantage over flag

on I think that's basically clyster like

Germany gets damaged by Swampert and

things that likes to relax and even

Metagross early on so he family doesn't

face hopping too much but you're rarely

gonna see oyster you don't check a DD or

team events oh it's great defense

standing up even to the powerful super

effective boost of attacks of course in

an early game when men's has that HP

girls flying around then the more

Spiteri ins might live one but another

interesting thing you might want to a

lot depends I'll leave it at that

since they could assume you're running a

physical thing and they might also think

well he doesn't guaranteed kill me so is

it really worth it because moisture is

really a wall to anything else and

that's how those offensive teams work

they have to zero in on the walls that

are actually going to present the the

roadblock for your other Pokemon and

click they're simply counter

anything so it's kind of like if boys

should get traded ferments then that

would generally be favorable for the

cloyster guy so yeah

forretress get snagged if it's too often

or if it's physical and experience then

you know obviously does not want

anything to do with it

I will say you know for eight run

explosion these days so you're not going

to see DD demesne yeah it's more likely

that you see it get uh get some spikes

and be annoying but Salomon's hovers

above and that is one of its most

valuable trace that cannot believe I

didn't mention it um yeah not be I mean

inspected by Sam but it doesn't care

about spikes you know scarf is

definitely layers it doesn't care it's

still threatening it's more its

teammates being threatened by what

scarce elements now and then being hit

by spikes that's the problem for example

switching into Aerodactyl when you've

got men's versus Aerodactyl not dee dee

no intimidate or anything or Starmie and

you've got three spikes down as you're

switching into the storm of your arrow

that's the problem

you know men's itself oh it's not gonna

be like oh we got three layers of spikes

and then my men's happen to be in range

for whatever weak attack Jirachi

psychically yeah so that's that

porygon to is a excellent unlit and/or

it is using choice banned Brick Break

this old max we've got it so mad and

yeah it's it hits hard with these

attacks so you're forcing to recover in

getting your your Snorlax or your

Metagross and and or your tea tart and

first thing to leave the Smackdown

without eating a hit on the switch so

that's a lot of what men's does in

certain matchups if it's not totally

pulverize and go to team sometimes just

forcing the recover

there's its role changing finally

Gyarados Erdos is one of the few ways

that physical offensive teams can check

mix mints

they really really really hate Mike

Spence

it's got a Sun it can thunder wave which

is it's not exactly threatening uh that

OCO men's back but yeah that's uh that's

um that's pretty much it oh man so

obviously can check DD Guerra eat more

easily than other men's because no

rockslide weaker attack HP rock is

exactly terrifying so yeah those are the

viability rankings and now before we

jump into the last segment which teams

then we go over the special relationship

Salamence has with the two psychic

skills of the tier Metagross and Jirachi

now there typing's are absolutely

incredible since there was just each

other's weaknesses so let's look at some

essence weaknesses ice rock those are

the big ones the ice beams and the rocks

mines both Metagross and Jirachi with

their typing and their stupendous bulk

and they don't care about sand switch it

on no problem matter Garissa Jirachi

hate fire ground meaning fire blasts and

earthquakes no problem

mence will eat that up now I mean this

is not to say that they're invincible

together things like knows I'm crazy but

their ability to pivot is possibly the

most pure example using your switches to

dance around offensive threats as

opposed to hard countering things yeah I

think that's that's pretty much it I

mean their types energies is so

excellent and it's why I'm mence wishes

to them easily if it chooses to do so on

an offensive set it's rare you'll see

draw to your meta gross on a bulky which

men's team or more commonly Jirachi

wishes last elements I mean even

something like men switch to a nun band

and teach our rocks not intimidating and

getting the wish it's like you know I

took I took some net percent curve for

the most part now I'm threatening them

thanks to the wish yeah

it's and they often simply support each

other fantastically I mean we've already

mentioned Metagross blowing waters and

skarmory up for men DD men's but I mean

even just whaling on the opponent breath

it's just enormous a matter of us also

checks men's itself as you can pretty

much imagine with its Titanic Bowl what

is it also be a victim especially the

more offensive sets that either invest

more into speed or sometimes they were

the ones without leftovers that those

are definitely prone to getting worn

down this is dealing with Tyranitar

jirachi as because it doesn't have as

monstrous physical defense but sometimes

on offensive sets if since it runs

tended max speeds it will go with ice

punch and that is largely first other

applications of course like flying on

harder hit on Salvy and Zapdos it's

great 20% freeze thanks but it's

primarily for us who would otherwise you

know I just kill it with banned or DD

and sweep in return which is the worst

so uh yeah I think that's it alright

final segment um teams common Salomon's

teams so we're not gonna really go into

the bulky wish all seems cuz they're not

really a staple of the meta game so

we're gonna stick with the the three

three big guns so this is not

comprehensive again just alright so

dragon dance I'm really gonna pair

buzzed this by the way money then play

TVs earthquake peroxide we'll just

assume earthquake or brick break so

we'll leave it blank um yeah so just you

know Adam in whatever

so here's route number one traditional

route number one

magneton you got you hate that guy the

big steel bird

Skarmory you got your Metagross your

impeccable defensive synergy with ments

you blow up the waters you're generally

good against a lot of the metagame cuz

you're so hard to kill and you've hit so

hard back

um Snorlax similar properties but

handles the special bad guys like Coon

and Starmie

phone as in suicune of course vacuum

Ness Jirachi who take a hit in return

is steel typing and that boat is just so

tough Celebi of course as backup and

also got self destruct so you know

you've got your you can do stuff like

meteor EQ explosion and then like HP

grass because sometimes you don't want

to blow up on Swampert but you gotta

make it sting but or you can do I mean

pretty much anything and run agility for

the sweep threat of your own pretty much

whatever you want - I'm just gonna

t-bolt and hidden power fire for for e

or grass for Swampert and then you know

your thunder wave to prevent setup from

men's and slowdowns at Bosworth then you

do things like Swampert you know defense

against other DD men's because this is

exactly the most pure operation no

matter how good you may think you are

with your intimidates which - Metagross

thing which is truly a thing of beauty

when it works I'm but you know you might

want some security or he wants to be

like you're like hey I'm already pretty

good with against the rocks no maybe

this guy is earthquake - oh I forgot to

mention this can run fruits too so that

you are chipping that bulky Gengar which

often will come in on Snorlax what's the

Magneton down if you're spamming

earthquake so teacher doesn't come in

for free and you know that ship can be

all you need you can sweet code you can

even use heracross you know as a bomber

bus you know hey the water took me out

well you know enter air cross so this is

one way to do it this is the weather

less mag approach approach number two is

pretty much you throat eat are in here

somewhere

and that means Sally Cara is generally

not so good an idea so you're gonna go

with arrow dose because something you

may have noticed without other teams

starving and mixed meds are terrifying

and that is the main reason to use

suicune / Swampert it is not as

immediately terrified of mixed nuts and

bolts right

those are terrible a terribly

threatening to the other ones

so you know he got used good for it you

generally don't want to use / on these

teams if you can help because that means

elevate gets annoying and I mean really

defensive salamy come on not to discount

defensive Selby or anything about it

just like well I'm trying to blast away

with physical things and then this I let

this dumb thing in there's even like

bulky sweeping you know you wanted it to

be all about the offense always bringing

it off and of course both these teams

you might notice hey Zapdos is scary

I mean relax can't stand up to it all

day so you really got to be on top of

your game you might have to blow it up

with better gross but hey then Gyarados

is happy so net positive and you got the

double intimidate for the physical

insurance alongside Metagross maybe you

give me this product defense here ease

maybe give Tyranitar some defensive ease

of course this kind of team also really

hates storming really really hates

Starmie um because you know ice beam

thunderbolt hydro pump this dies a hydro

pump - even if it's really bulky from

like any damage all uh and Metagross not

really switching relaxants and so here

so and the other team is often gonna

deal with san you can't count on their

not being sad because if there's often

some storming there's probably gonna be

a trans heart and why is it doesn't do

anything to like Milotic and suicune and

that's just the place so even celibate

becomes two plots so you're gonna have

to be careful the kind of team

definitely requires a heads up play also

choice pants alamut's is totally totally

viable again on these kinds of teams but

you really have to make your defenses or

fill it up or that you know how you're

gonna deal with threats that handle and

unvoiced in Salomon's because what DD

men's does is even if you maybe now

you're faster now you don't deal with

those guys so it gives you the extra

sweep yeah so that's why he commenced

its preferred yeah the final kind of DD

men's team is gonna be pretty much these

guys with you know this will become

choice bangers + power perks car the or

can be mixed you know plumberry for

WISPIRG our our teacher can also pursuit

of course our fire sometimes they run

psychic for Gengar just to really lock

it down hit zapdos hard without blowing

up maybe your HP rock Garrow it's

advantage of that and you know your

auntie way where you run todd for

Skarmory this can run like curse curse

boom

t chars gonna get in your way so you

want to make sure that hey i'm gonna

take advantage of the teat are going

down i that's one less check for

salamence maybe a slowrun brick break

because Blissey is annoying and these

last lots can run you know or they can

run Zapdos here they very commonly do

Aerodactyl is also a common one on these

teams with this the this line of up

stakes is incredibly flexible and can

run a ton of things this gives you sweet

food and special insurance while really

pounding Skarmory and Ubaid in the soft

special wall for these guys this really

gets scary

hit big dude big damage you might think

hey well you know bulky Swampert what

what's so bad about and you can go bulky

but you can also go with this set which

wall it's not going to make your Milotic

worries any easier that's why you got to

get in there with lacks and do some

damage maybe you got a faded scar bait

the water seems were big on those maybe

just damage it with the men switch in

and you you switch the Zapdos and you go

from there as they go to Selby or Plessy

or whatever I'm you completed salic Burt

but you can also run the newfangled

hydro ice beam earthquake focus punch so

suddenly bliss ease not walling you

suddenly things are getting scary Mac's

special attack bata speed plus special

tag nature refresh is good

modest is okay yeah it's so this is

offense and defense since you've got the

meadows and the intimidate and the

generally bulky team to make up for lack

of bulk two points I can make here one

this settlements can easily

easily become this set same team same

exact team um and you you know it's just

a different approach this time you're

more hitting scarm pert really hard from

the get-go and maybe you didi with tar

maybe you still pursue just because

Gengar is that annoying and it opens up

a window for men's to be scary on its

own

yeah so that's point number one this is

pretty much the classic mixed men's team

um and then the second point is that

this perp running offensive Vivi's is

quite common now if the far away is so

annoying that you want to hit it and

Laura and make sure that you can bust

holes with your Metagross your Mets your

Lacs your tar your heracross whatever

Stella be even not Gyarados but the cost

of dropping that bulk is that while yes

you definitely can run you definitely

and still take a hit or two especially

with good pivoting in a timid support

remember swapper doesn't happen takes

would be your immediate switch into

every physical attacker to help out with

especially this guy not a TV sweeper and

does can be a little more cavalier with

itself but yeah this thing is a lot more

prone to getting pounded by +1 Salamence

I mean where it's going to use choice

man for easy example but yeah that

that's a ton of damage and it's probably

gonna take a hit from one of these guys

so yeah this it's DD menses in a good

against offensive teams because they're

named faster but that also means are

getting less bulky is they're not going

to give up on to power so that's a

that's an important thing to notice so

like your teams like the Zapdos Dugtrio

ganga aarti tar swafford Jirachi those

kinds of teams the often splints you can

interchange whatever your favorite

offensive pokemon is there and put your

favorite offensive both - playing any of

brutalized by men's after 50p

that's why I met so threatenings my

steel he gets that opportunity often

dunk trio or just an offensive Celebi so

that's the classic mix men's team now

we're gonna see the second kind of mix

men's team bulkier bearing which meet

Eric

and you know for a wind whatever and

then your perp becomes bulky so we're

just gonna act I mean throwing your

toxic surf or fresh know this if you

want or whatever you want like

earthquake ice beam that kind of thing

but it's basically the point is hurt is

bulky relaxed pulled whatever and

teachers probably stayin guitar is

staying actually this becomes a Blissey

cuz you got that rubbery no whatever and

this becomes Gengar and suddenly you've

got a defensive core to fall back on and

it matchups against other defensive

teams well I guess other teams in

general because salamence breaks apart

those offensive teams as you saw and

then you've got a legitimate damage

source as well as a way of falling back

on heracross which is one of these teams

greatest nemesis so this is this is

where mixed menses are really really

nice

um yeah expense is really really

terrifying here also another great

transition and this is the last segment

choice band works here especially

because this guy or this gal rather and

ridin fish and medicines gonna stay

healthy I mean some some players like to

go with magnet on here is if it's so

much easier dance around that you mean

rather than now going back to Gengar and

you know making this fire bus where you

can if you're a brave player but

remember this is gonna give Skarmory

health this is probably gonna get

scrubbing out because you're not gonna

fire blast and push on the same set this

this might scarce farm-raised sure but

this - because you can poke on it so

it's not a ton generally and skarmory

magnet on teams are very multifaceted of

Salomon's is in Saladin's is a great

pick on them because it helps with

heracross which is Carrie and just

provides general help with defensive

utility and it's it's speedy so media

damage is always nice so men cells as

well because this trans are very easily

run to pursue

as for now the more traditional and

banned men's Magneton teams besides um

this is the last variant besides just

fueling besides just the one earlier you

know the physical options team accept

immense advantage instead of DD then

trap teams so you got your Snorlax ball

came so first you got your duct ryoga's

what trap then you got your Snorlax and

the primary beneficiary and then

something like Celebi because batad

passing out of t tar and skarmory you

know it's these guys in and then either

your Milotic expense is annoying and it

just is generally a good state powder to

the physical guys especially alongside
