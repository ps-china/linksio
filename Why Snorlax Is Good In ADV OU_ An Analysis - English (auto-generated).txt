what's up guys today we are going over

the role of a DB OU's most plus-size

pokemon snorlax whose HP stat is as

impressive as his speed is abysmal what

do his stats typing and move tool do for

him how does he

realistically function within the

metagame what does he beat what stops

him etc let's find out the first thing

we shall learn about Snorlax with the

third generation of overused is that it

shall always use immunity as its ability

the reason why is that there are several

pok√©mon that Snorlax should deal with

and part of being able to deal with them

so easily hinges on its ability to not

be affected by toxic pls Pokemon well

it's mainly Blissey but it can also

include Oregon to Skarmory Zapdos

jirachi

and any water type of toxic know like

Milotic and it threatens those in

various forms

you know Skaar rain being the most

dubious of those but the others it

mostly threatens but by allowing them to

toxic you you give them a lame to play

around you that does not have to be

there and you might be thinking well I

see these two sent over here Chris rest

in self-destruct if I'm going Chris rest

and just rest off the toxic if I'm going

self-destruct I'm just gonna blow up

anyway so big deal let me tell you why

that's nonsense

first rest does not want to be forced

into a premature rest because that

allows the opponent to play around you

in win-win scenarios for example they

can make riskier switches that aren't

really that risky because even if you

predict that switch and don't rest then

you're still taking the toxic damage and

then you're going to get picked off

anyway being dictated your rest being

dictated by the opponent when it doesn't

have to be is just nonsense it makes it

it makes it harder to beat Pokemon that

you should just be dominating as for the

self-destruct you're thinking well if

I'm gonna blow up anyway was the big

yes sir that is the same thing but by

being forced into over and over health

you are being dictated to and when you

can realistically would excuse me I'm

blabbering the window in which you have

to self-destruct is not dictated by the

attacks you'll take but just by being on

the field and that window shuts really

really fast and that what's the opponent

play around it a lot more easily and the

reward you get by forgoing immunity is

basically nothing I mean I ice and fire

resistance I mean look look at this

thing's bulk without investment that's

incredible

who cares about those moves it doesn't

have any special weaknesses and it may

as well resist most special attacks for

a little at us they do so use immunity

this is like a number one advanced

mistake it's not really number one but

it's a big one like if you see someone

using and thicknesser eyes you know that

their picture of the tier is incomplete

so now let's move on to the sets this is

the classic Sarlacc set right out of GSC

the premise is simple first to bolster

weak defense and strengthen attack so it

can't be stalled out special defense is

already handled no special weaknesses in

theory seems pretty unkillable

yes and no we'll get to that the sets

first of all it always runs leftovers

but you probably already knew that the

moves body-slammed because stab is good

and the I can move is up for debate

Shadow Ball is the standard because you

cannot be completely walled by Gengar

with six cursors but there are other

ways of dealing with Gengar such as

pursue so you go with earthquake because

steel types and Tyranitar are just the

worst so those are the two main options

us there are some fringe options as well

now this seems kind of ridiculous but

hidden power steel hits an important

trio of Pokemon Tyranitar a very common

check it hits a gang guard which isn't

always enough but it can be it can be

better than being completely helpless

against it

giving Gengar of super free switches

generally not something you want to do

and that is works relaxants greatest

weaknesses but it can also be one of

Sciences greatest strengths we'll get

into that later in power steel also hits

Aerodactyl now this is rather nish so it

doesn't really see a ton of use but it

does exist if our plug is the other one

still hit steet are the hints Gengar for

like to damage but you know it's

something but the main draw is that it

hits

Celebi and leech seed Celebi is one of

the most commons phalanx of colors so it

is something worth considering however I

would leave the hidden powers for the

less experienced players so don't bother

with those there's also the option of

sleep-talk just to really limit the

amount of turns the opponent has Chuck

strikes down offensively because if

you're counting on it being helpless

during those two turns to wail on it

with Metagross for us too many curses

then you can be cut short by you know

body slam hitting a

Eric Ross is trying to focus punch or

curse giving it that extra defense boost

it means to live something so that's an

option too but it super requires pursuit

support so yeah there are also some

options that just go well I want to hit

Gengar and I want to hit Tyranitar and

Metagross and jirachi so who really

needs to have anyway and they run this

variant which you know in theory is

pretty okay yes nor this us relax set

definitely specializes in taking down

bulkier teams not going to consistently

be very good against the more offensive

squads with things like Metagross

salamence powerful Zapdos variants

durant are of course heracross even

Dugtrio finishing it off can be tough if

it's caught on the right turn so and of

course opposing Snorlax with things like

focus punches suppertime we'll get to

that

Eevee's I gotta say evening Snorlax is

something that even the best advanced

players struggle with there is really no

right answer well there are some answers

that are more correct than others the

main one being don't invest in HP until

you've invested in the defense's first

business it's kind of like why Blissey

always matches its defense and usually

doesn't bother with HP V's so on a curse

set you can go from adamant to you know

just hit things harder be hard to stall

out for things like the steals and

Celebi and you could even run enough

attack which would allow you to OCO

don't trio which I believe is around

this number let's check it out look show

Snorlax for slacks

yeah that's that's the one 116 is a

guarantee even on for defense Dugtrio so

there you go that's what you need them

that's your number then you honestly I

can't tell you what the correct deities

are but my recommendation would be

figure out what you want to survive what

you want to take certain amounts of

damage from and play around in the

calculator to find the optimal spread

because sometimes you might just say

well I want to take all the fiscal

attacks let me just cram this in there

but then you could you know do a little

less and throw in a little here and this

HP would help with taking the special

attacks too so really play around with

it some players like careful because

they well

Zapdos does a ton of damage as you will

see here this might not seem like a lot

17% chance to 4ko with leftovers but you

got to remember sand exists and sand

doesn't work in the calc I'm sorry but

this gets uncomfortable really fast

because remember how we talked about

toxic forcing a premature arrest whole

Zapdos is the primary offense special

offensive pokemon that forces premature

arrests with its attacks which it can

just throw out so that's another thing

we'll be going over later but some

people like careful for that purpose as

well as things like boosted sweet moon

like old sweet gun I mean even with

Snorlax invested in attack and you know

boosting its body slam bolt suicune is a

real tank so I can set up call mines and

not take that much and you know looks

white I do that and so that can be messy

especially with potential roar so you're

gonna want to do as much damage as you

can anyway so some people like careful

number couldn't tell you but an

underrated option I believe is impish

because people are gonna send in their

Metagross wail on you and you know after

a curse do this but you know I think the

option of this should not be thick

uh yeah I mean you're still getting

chunk like this but like look at that

meteor mash a lot of Metagross don't

like to immediately explode because what

if they hit their wrong target

so having that option is really really

nice so and then you know as you

accumulate more and more curses then it

gets lower and lower and you see it

would probably have some more investment

than this but uh yeah so ambitious is a

good option and you know mix in some HP

mixing some because some people

subscribe the ideas first rest lacks

doesn't really need attack because

you're supposed to get a million curses

okay so that's what curse rest relax

does and we will get into some of its

other intricacies later now we are going

to the more offensive realm of Snorlax

uh and that is with self-destruct the

complete opposite of rest by the 12

speed V's here are because I mean you

could feasibly have them here as well

but since you're going to be cursing a

lot then it's not always not always the

twelve speedy these allow you to

outspeed a paralyzed

Aerodactyl which can be crucial since

you're throwing around body slam at all

so it's usually a worthy investment then

some lacks like to creep each other but

still X tends to be starved enough for

eby's in my experience I mean I know

that sounds crazy but it's because you

want your attacks to hit things hard but

you also want to bolt to do something

because even though wall Snorlax could

feasibly function with no eby's at all

you don't want it to like you want it to

be able to shrug off those Zapdos

Thunderbolts but you also want its focus

punch to dense Skarmory things of that

nature so I wouldn't get too crazy I

mean a couple more is fine but you know

don't go ugly you know with this much

this many species these I'll never get

out so anyway other select no pawn in

that trap so we have a couple options

here the classic is well there are a lot

of classics here but let's start with

the mixed Snorlax because you're gonna

want to use this on offensive team the

objective is to take hits and dish em

out

of course dishing out hits doesn't do

much good if you're easily walled so at

the primary thing that easily while

Snorlax is Skarmory so what do you get

brave and you get rid of the speedy

beasts and you throw on fire blasts now

it doesn't do a ton so you're gonna want

to do some investment it could be from

this this again play around in the calc

no one's found the optimal smell on TV I

don't think and we'll get more into the

functioning of fire watch layer you can

also have Shadow Ball because fire

blastin sand will bring down Gengar to

the less the backs HP which is often all

you need for that DD men's to sweep but

sometimes you want to hit a little

harder maybe hit on the switch before it

will ellipse you then of course there's

earthquake which is of course very

viable with Tranter Metagross jirachi

those are big targets then you can use

focus punch because taranis hard gets

helped by this and earthquake kind of

need to hit it a couple times which can

get messy given such as potential

longevity issues with this set but focus

punches the attempt to make everything

get smacked focus punch will also often

commonly run Shadow Ball since focus

punch is also for Skarmory since it does

not run drill pick that often and if it

does it's not running toxic or it's not

running protect or it's giving up

something which makes it easier to

either beat down repeatedly or switch

into with Zapdos and things like that

so yeah this is that's another variant

another variant that you usually see on

the mixed variant another smoothie

usually simple mixer is counter with how

many physical attacks this guy can take

it's essentially game-changing I mean

obviously don't stay in on a CV card

because it could just focus punch

through before you ever get that counter

off but something like a matter of

meteor mash which usually I mean you're

gonna want to pump some defensive ease

as a meta versus uninvested curse lacks

it's gonna do a lot and you ideally want

to do it a two-for-one where you counter

the Metagross and then you blow up on

something weak like my load anchor

something sleeping ideally I guess yeah

you're gonna want to pump those defense

v's especially because it you also like

it when Dugtrio can't revenge you from

really really high health as seen the

difference the movies make I mean that's

that's a fun yeah so yeah II being star

loss is a great mystery and you know I

wish you good luck in figuring it out

I'm pretty sure every ad player uses

different movies on their likes on their

various LAX's in fact lex and yeah i'm i

can't remember a time where I've used

the BBC it's the same AV spread on a

snorlax twice even if it was the same

set and it's not even team dependent is

just well let me try a different way to

be be my last this time around well I

think that's that's covered most of the

variants all but I did mention is curse

self-destruct this Skarmory we'll get to

the potential issues might have but this

will pretty much take out anything you

need

besides Gengar which is why you're in

shadow ball okay those are snow

experience now let's get to their

problems because there are a lots

potential piece but it's also a

potential huge huge enormous liability

why is it such a liability well let's

start with the curse rest set what stops

cursed Snorlax the answer usually is

book Laden and of itself all conditions

brought about by those Pokemon I am of

course referring to the sandstorm

brought by it brought on by Tyranitar

and the spikes brought on by Skarmory in

addition to walling the standard curse

lacks set of this

forever and Internet or skis hitting it

hard then they also know just make it

hard for some ice to even switch in and

I mean well Snorlax is really bulky if

you've ever played GSC you know how hard

it is to take a Snorlax down with

competed hits but suddenly with sand in

the picture and with multiple spikes

then that means onyx is gonna roll over

in crumbling switch in once maybe twice

and since it's not doing that much

immediate damage then it's not that much

of a threat the worst core for I mean

most Snorlax to face is transferred

Gengar Skarmory very common stuff so it

can be problem it can be a real problem

to get around when they can just pretty

much easily sit on it and you're

thinking well why don't I just you know

the earthquake for the thr with curses

not so bad if I can magnet on the

strawberry and you're like yeah I think

anger comes around now of course we can

get around these issues but they are not

all tronic spaces over for now let's see

how it can get around those Magneton is

pretty much always going to be seen with

this there's just no way around it you

cannot not kill Skarmory with this so

it's just out of the question to have

anything else I mean you can try things

like blowing it up with CV Metagross

before it ever gets a chance to do

anything you can try things like refresh

claydol to just permanently sit on it

and but realistically you are going to

use Magneton with this so because

otherwise every single time I mean the

Metagross example is one thing but it's

not like some LAX's issues and they're

so an option is Magneton and then you

can also run Dugtrio will get two full

teams that lacks often finds itself on

later but for now we'll say it is a

prime beneficiary of the double trap

strategy at any of its effect thanks

Barbie Metagross Sorachi are prone to

Magneton and Dugtrio and the trapping

can even extend to Gengar since that is

weak to pursue and some less rocks is

looking for you

Carrie because turns out yeah it's

checks are really really good but once

you remove those checks you see how good

some ice is against everything else

Celebi is another prime target for

Dugtrio

because it's leech seed set as we've

said is they prime Snorlax check so yeah

once you get past those and I know that

sounds ridiculous and kind of because it

is you know once you remove you know one

two three maybe four counters then yeah

fortune Alliance is pretty good but the

fact of the matter is it can be worth it

just because of how good Swan relax is

that wouldn't be one of wanting things

like that Lisi squeaking room sometimes

yeah it can often feel like it's not

going anywhere but things like Milotic -

and but if that's the idea of taking

asteroids this set requires a lot of

trap support the knives you even throw

in a clay doll just because even with

even with Skarmory dead then that one

spike it probably got before it died -

Magneton 10b you know I mean 12% is not

nothing guys so it can be the push that

the other guy needs to force your legs

to rest and deal with it that way so

clay doll sometimes comes along and some

time changing the weather because just

throwing sand sand like a difference is

colossal so it sounds pretty extreme and

it is but that's how Goodson elections

against the parts of the metagame that

are not countering it this makes it

sound like strikes is just you know kind

of a wimpy you know well eighty percent

of the other team and then I'm really

good I mean and it is a valid complaint

but it is worth knowing about just

because of how lethal it can be so yeah

trans hard Dugtrio Scarberry maggot on

sometimes Gengar a lot but it's it's a

lot easier that you think because you

know you bait in with Snorlax you

one of the targets in and then you

remove them but it's also not quite as

easy as that

because good player knows hey this guy's

a Snorlax good chance of Magneton so

it's about playing the game and figuring

your opponent out and each of they're

trying to dance around your strategy

while executing their own aka Pokemon so

that's that's Chris respiratory I mean

it's got other problems like Metagross

naturally just kind of annoys it but

we've already established that it's not

going to do so well this whole curse

resting in the face of powerful

offensive people usually not gonna fly

so you might even think hey well I can

boost on Swampert but even Swampert you

know these days it runs off into focus

punch sets and even before that on some

offensive teams it ran a sub and ever

set which is just relaxed so you got a

offensive suicune I mean look bodyslam

taro will be annoying yeah but suicune

blows through lacks it comes in big

combines on the switch so and I mean

even this set I mean that it's wall by

Jirachi so offensive jirachi I mean

Celebi and Sam against and so much hates

and possibly more than anything else

besides sweet to them who is only enough

a very common partner on those track

teams so yeah maybe sucks this said it's

more about taking down the remainders of

defensive then it is about taking our

conference but some special office gets

struggle with it like all mine stuff

with porygon - and the ones with no teat

are especially but those are not as

common as they once were not nearly as

common so san just really really is a

thorn in its side and you have to

account for it okay so that's curse rest

relaxants many issues myriad issues even

we asked if you faced a defensive team

with like Milotic and Magneton and clay

doll I mean smash kind of does well

against the teams that it finds itself

on and by that I mean the trap teams

that it finds itself on also kind of

tend to be weak to other lacks because

they lack the tools that usually

Ward's nor lights off so I mean yeah

switching into gang I mean anger and

it's Todd will whisper worse I don't

even explodes and it can be really messy

so this is not a slap on team and

automatic win button not that those

really exist an advanced but there are

Pokemon they're definitely more easily

wielded for results than this set set

requires you to really be aware of the

metagame and your opponent so let's move

on to self-destruct so this set is a lot

more self-sufficient because the power

of a stab self-destruct is so great that

even if it takes that Gengar burn it's

at least going to chunk something like

let's for example use a standard max HP

Tyranitar and let's use a the deck sets

are not very accurate I like like this

three attack rest thing it this is like

a GSC set though so yeah like see this

this is already a ton this is barely any

investment so now you make it burned and

that's still you know that's still not

unusable damage that's putting it in

Dugtrio range for example so and

sometimes you might have more investment

let's just say fix

good so the last will barely is max

attacking this is just preference of

mine but yeah put it around here as the

minimum we should go to so what is the

role of this Snorlax

while this Snorlax is supposed to take

its things from that dose and suicune

and offensive variants of these guys and

it's supposed to hit back very often you

will see it taking a DDD attack from

Salomon's and blowing it up not your

traditional counter but it's bulky

enough to take hits from so much that

it's part becomes utility in and of

itself because it's so strong

so that is its its main use it's not

easy to switch into relax that is going

more on the offensive so let's take the

shadow ball focus punch set which is

agreed upon by most to be the most

effective because if you're running a

fire blast a fire blast mix blacks

against scarm Gengar t tar then it's

just a horrible feeling as skara brae

spikes in your face and protects because

our last is nothing not to mention the

form lag your sit not horrible but you

know when you're doing so little and

it's low peak medium that it can switch

to keep bar and even if you have

earthquake then it can go to gang garlic

and we'll wisp you and you're just even

more useless than before and it is just

horrible so this kind of maximizes the

power you're gonna be dishing out shadow

ball makes Gengar think twice about

switching in course with fire blasts

it's like oh well I have Gengar so I can

just swish right into it big deal

focus punch I like a lot of attack

because I really like this thing

Scarberry and I think that is generally

advisable a big benchmark for this is

you're going to be wanting to be able to

deal with offensive suicune who's hydro

pumping things I'm not saying you have

to go careful max max but you're going

to wanna like see this it's not breaking

50 that's generally what you want I mean

if it's if you get to the calculus like

50 point one max they're like fifty

point four which is something I've

gotten to just by playing around the

numbers in here for way too long then

you know that's gonna be okay because

realistically products might not even be

a full health you might just blow up

immediately that's really just so you

can um try to land a body slam paralysis

on it before you commit to blowing up

because if you can land the slam para

then you might not even lose your waxed

that kind of thing but yeah you're

generally going to I mean look at that

that's a burn self destruct against

something as both v as max HP oh that's

zero attack too so yeah the idea

of course if you think what this Snorlax

is well it's definitely more intuitive

to brain since you just certainly

smacking everything in sight something

to know is that you really have to with

both your team and your playing you have

to make what it hits count because I

mean what good is it you know taking the

burn for a shadow ball Gengar if you if

Shaun doesn't do anything else and then

you don't even have something to

capitalize on it um like an example

would be hey I took a bird to hit the

Gengar but that's crucial because now I

know I'm going to sweep with DD man's

because I can't take my flying anymore

and sir like still comes in the water

it's even though it's burned I mean I

have a limited window but that's how the

team's this relaxed that operates on or

is placed on this is how they operate

they know they don't have all the time

in the world they've gotta make their

attacks you gotta hit hard and they have

to choose the right attacks now you know

what are the right attacks that's for

you to decide in each and every battle

which is unique but generally you don't

want to just I don't want to say

passively bodyslam but it is kind of

passive when you're like well this guy

seems to be running a defensive team let

me just bodyslam I see goes to one of

scarm t tar or Gengar and you know you

gotta you gotta say okay I'm gonna focus

punch and Visitor's examples I'm gonna

focus punch because Gengar is frail and

it doesn't want to eat a stray fire

blast if it can help it since it needs

his health and skarmory is safe for at

least a turn no matter what and if I get

T tar that's great even if he does go

Gengar I can Shadow Ball after and if I

think he's just pivoting I can even

focus punch again if I'm feeling brave

these are the kind of these are the

examples I'm talking about you have to

really be aggressive with this kinda guy

if you're facing a team that's not

really doing that much damage like some

sort of mind loading balanced but yeah

you can just kind of spam body slam and

be like yeah you know let's see what

happens it's not like they're

threatening me

that's your comfort zone but with relax

you have to be aware of how badly it can

be messed up so the aim of this

is how fall victim to that so focus

point shadow wall and I'm you could also

run earthquake

now we're mostly talking non Magneton

teams here however if you have a magnet

on then smell the smacking scar me down

going her concern so you can run this

more ideal to be idealized set since

earthquake it's of course superior in

dealing with meta doors in jirachi if

you can help especially if you lay the

be slant para with the other set the

concern is more Skarmory so you'll take

a little less damage on Metagross and

Jirachi because they are not as

threatening as Skarmory threatens to be

with its spikes that choke your entire

team so that's the point and you know

push comes to shove against those guys I

mean look let's just throw in this

standard Metagross there and take out

the bird that's not bad at all that's a

ton of damage that's an Aerodactyl ready

to go crazy that's at each heart ready

to go crazy so you know push comes to

shove yeah you can play around with like

the Fire Blast counter stuff but that's

also the most pro in beginning played

around and stuff that those guys I mean

fire blast kind of just sucks you know

I mean if fortress is really a concern

for your you know pounding offense team

by the way fortress has to respect fire

blast because unlike Safari it gets

respect so it you know you have some

leeway there but fire blast just kind of

doesn't do much else it's like a it's a

weak attempt at hitting scarm so and

counter is admittedly amazing

potentially however with the kind again

Metagross can be dealt with if even with

your relaxed I mean just a body slam

para will do a ton and if it's Lum then

doesn't have left it so is scar very is

red number one well I shouldn't say some

teams like the scar without the sand is

not that bad because as you'll notice

with Pokemon like swamp tour Metagross

and jirachi the ones with leftovers that

are immune to

and they're like spikes are annoying but

it'll be gone after a couple and when

there's no Sam that's relax focus

punching Skarmory down at times of the

same thing doesn't have a bow I didn't

even bring it teacher this makes it so

much easier so that's idea and you know

again more attack you mean scarm is

annoying so I think

so yeah this is it's not the 3ko it's

more about whaling on it and making sure

that this is each hit is gonna count I

mean you can go higher and this is

pretty strong so I mean breaking 40 is

nice so yeah so I think that's accurate

and so I mean you'll be able to another

common function is uh switching into

mixed meds who most often sit too late

you know coming into us an HP glass

aimed at swampert big um vassula duplex

TVs are also good for swapper EQ because

very often you know it'll be trying to

ice beam your salamence or something or

like your non-hp grass Zapdos and you'll

want to come in and then I'll post the

swapper guy might go well I kind of want

this thing we get for my own Zapdos so

you might hit you with an earthquake and

the less damage he does the better I'm

not saying go max max but you know do

your cows and of course be careful of

suicune or you know be ready to boom

immediately on it if push comes to shove

may be invested as that goes but we'll

see that when we get to the kind of

teams this guy functions on yeah I think

I think that has covered most of the

threats that are like spaces and how it

can work around them

Celebi is I mean less annoying because

you can blow it up again have something

to abuse it maybe you gotta Zapdos maybe

have a sweet hood as well see in those

okay so this has been kind of like a

lifestyle and in suck and how to make it

suck less kind of thing so I want to

focus on the good things Esther likes

does and there are plenty of them

because you know the title of this video

after all is why sirloins is good in AD

do you it's only weaknesses to fighting

and while there are focus punches to be

found and you know these guys that carry

focus punch or sorry this guy mainly and

sometimes this guy coming like weaker

stop like Gengar which doesn't really do

that much because it needs to invest too

much and tonics can invest a lot to it

anyway these guys are gonna beat

smacking it really hard anyway but

you'll notice that Snorlax doesn't

really take that much damage from

anything

I mean sure like heracross who can't

switch in I should add and after a curse

it's a lot less threatening I mean even

a Seabee brick break I know why sleep

talk is still there oh yeah I like your

a/c be brick break I mean yeah that can

be worth it but you know the +1 let's

call it this is doing a lot so it's it's

not a safe switch because Mellon's can

just spin by same that is the good and

strikes not a lot I mean if you hit it

really hard you're gonna be seriously

invested so most players will slow it

down that's where the scarm Gengar thing

comes it's not like Scarman Gengar

aren't calling it it's that they're

slowing it down

that's what Stella B does I mean you

think Selby is Harry Isis help anytime

soon

no it's making it to a liability so the

idea of those teams that try to you know

remove everything from the game before

strikes can be let loose I mean it's not

only effective because Snorlax baits

those things in in the first place but

also because of strikes is innate a

fantastic ability to does not take that

much damage from things because it's not

weak to that much and the face powers

and you know attacking sets though

usually don't go together I mean Trent

are rockslides sometimes sure but I mean

it's it's strong but it's not you know a

world beater I mean I've got C beat are

you know against a prior lead dammit I

mean and this is not like an active

threat at all but you know for a choice

panic attack including this strong

against accursed likes this isn't that

much I know it's not the right spread

but you know it doesn't change that much

I mean it's a lot but you can have more

of the more from rockslide flinch and

things of that nature any of course you

you're one of those guys who goes in

fish then you know things get really

hairy someone's visit even break 30

after one so yeah so it's nice ken

starr's is a Pokemon that can be a huge

liability but it can also be a game

winner like no other

so it's ability i mean this is more

going for this slow-burn win against the

opponent really preying on the fact that

it's not a price of the fact that humans

can't hurt it but it also has to deal

with all the residual damage ways that

adds up really really fast I mean like

sandstorm one spike down switch it is

Aptos thunderbolt and then all it's

threatening me with are these two moves

off of not very invested attack I mean

I'm probably not that scared with just a

standard team so um but the thing is if

as soon as your your big guys which are

prone to trapping go down then this

becomes scary the the problem lies in

more even Pokemon that it doesn't that

supposed to be can be threatening by

virtue of that passive damage see mostly

the Zapdos example so this guy he's by

this guy's where it really shines I

think most advanced players will agree

that this guy is more of a playmaker

game changer shot-caller all that kind

of stuff because he's powerful he

doesn't focus on trying to wall and

outlast everything as much as you think

his plasmas potential bolt the backup

thing inside and take things I mean

you're not going to be able to perfectly

counters things so sometimes you take

the baddest blob you can fight in front

of the other guy and blow it up I mean

salamence is scary but it's not going to

be muscling through its parallax after

one dragon dance or even two it was

healthy so I mean you're not going to be

countering it carries a person million

times what matters more is that you get

it in against Aptos and you make those

turns that it is in now so I think

that's that's pretty accurate

fairly comprehensive and all that I

guess it's like a bulky team with my

loaded clay all Magneton strikes is

probably gonna go crazy

so both variants you know if they're

they're bigger they're the best card of

this is ally cheating Celebi or like

you're even better at their own curse

then you know uh-huh that's very funny

and here you just trying to go crazy

just spamming attacks all the live long

day because they can't really hurt you

so okay teams let's get two teams oh

well first go with curse rest so as

mentioned earlier this can be a lot of

stuff an example here would be maggots

on clay at all and then you know you

pick your choice and folky stuff Celebi

because leech and baton pass can bethe

and skarmory Tyranitar because crunch

and pursue and that means you don't need

to use Dugtrio because this thing can

run earthquake and then you run suicune

because it also enjoys notnot Skarmory

no spikes so yeah you know Oh mines hurt

but it's okey and this is just an

example

um these teams I gotta say I am NOT the

biggest fan of and many players feel the

same because in that whole all going all

in on the Snorlax sweep you kind of

forget certain offensive press I mean

look at how bad this is against

heracross it is just absolutely shredded

and many permutations of this team are

going to have similar problems I mean

you can have you can throw in your

Dugtrio you can throw in your weather

change Zapdos which would of course go

with with shadow ball acts things like

this I mean it's it's something because

her and wind introvert in revenge but

you know something like a salad hair

cross is just destruction utter utter

destruction so that but if you're really

aiming to hit those bulky teams where

they live then you know you you trap

them you remove their spikes you remove

the sands and you know then these two

guys kind of go crazy that's the idea

anyway you just got to be really careful

about those the more traditional team

with this is you know you're gonna

accept the sand you're gonna accept this

bike because these guys are just so

powerful and instead you get some extra

offense so you get Celebi protector

trapping scarm before it even gets to

spike down doing the same thing to

Tyranitar in case they want to switch in

so they don't get Magneton and you know

you do things like check other snow

lights nicely and then the plastic team

leftovers is a choice band and you know

other stuff other moves you know offense

and some defense like heracross and

stuff like that this can also be a

Milotic because dragon dancers are scary

and so is other sweet throw sometimes

and so is mixed elements and Metagross

can be annoying because Snorlax is sweet

cool being forced to rest is kind of

similar to Snorlax

that's why they it so well together when

the passive damage is being nullified

somehow or being turned into offense of

your own or being removed and then they

kind of thrive but yeah this so it's

pretty much mag trio you know water type

and Shelby and then this I mean you can

also throw in stuff like Metagross so

bulky and loves Skarmory gone or you can

throw in jirachi because you know wish

all mine it's also really good and you

know extra healing is nice

I mean relax loves not having to rest

nicely and so but I mean you kind of get

the picture and I mean you have to be

careful because with this for example

then Flygon with a spike down would just

go crazy so elements lot so and of

course uh yeah so that's pretty much

this or the Magneton clay doll route

looks as various various permutations

yeah I think that's fair to say

okay now self-destructs this also goes a

couple of ways Snorlax is naturally a

fit on magnet on offense because of all

its wonderful qualities Tex waters blows

things up generally hard to kill his

heart so no it's good stuff so we're

gonna go with the earthquake set on this

you know the

all-out attacker this needs back attack

a little less because it's not quite a

focus punches farmerie down it's not a

concern you got your mag for that and

it's got other synergy like blowing up

blowing up a celibate for Metagross one

of them would probably blow up you know

Metagross might blow up a water which

would mean that the Salamence really got

like is really good with excuse me the

silence is really good with the with

their Celebi remaining and water and

skarmory gone and you know or spikes

myoglobin Celebi which means that

Celebes not switching into Metagross or

if Metagross blows up on Celebi then

snaps relax handles the water you see

how they uh right these two are very

common together on offensive teams got

your video master explosion there are

other things you can run pursuit for

Gengar does usually these teams are just

kind of like alright isn't already

Dugtrio statue is a big problem for

these to you then I'll just kind of

throw it in there and if it's got fire

punch then you know that kind of sucks

and I'll deal with it some other way

like Swampert or oh wait mum on

Metagross or you know Tyranitar or

heracross heracross isn't really current

it's fired up better kind of his fire

punch is just the fire grass wisp and

gar is really annoying here but that's

something else you gotta take into

account so yeah this is kind of what

those teams look like I mean you guys

throw in your teat are your Gyarados

your your Aerodactyl your whatever relax

is anchors these teams very nicely and

since you know in the spirit of not

laying duck trio run all over you but

you might run some more defense than

usual I'm putting in random numbers here

but you get the idea you also might take

care to be safe against suicune and you

know since you're here you may as well

throw in those 12 for paralyzed arrow as

unlikely as I found that scenario to be

so here's just an example don't you

without calculates for yourself yeah so

I

I will leave that that this was crude no

just standard magnet on offense and the

snow action is going to be big here and

warding off mixed elements because

Salamence is scary you're gonna come in

on you're gonna want to come in on fire

blast major congrats and even in sand

that adds up so make sure every kick

counts yeah and maybe invest in a

Gyarados that's also up Easton idea yeah

Durant are is also helpful because it

can take a brick break from high health

and you got these two massive

Intimidators to draw attacks for it to

coming on so anyway you get the idea

tronics is put on baguette on offense

now what about non magnet on offense um

well it's still really good it's just

that now you're going to really want to

hit that Skarmory because Skarmory this

is probably I mean this could be banded

because and you're just gonna want to

blow it up or just wail on it with

repeated meteor matches you've got to be

careful about those scar magnets on

teams where they get a spike and then

cracking Metagross with magnet on and

it's just like what's the point of life

so but it's also an option to go mix

with like HP fire and Lum for Gengar

this is best intercept rash or quiet

depending on your exemple play it but

yeah this this is often gonna be mixes

dope yeah you got your tea tar which can

be dance mix band whatever just kind of

keeping the offensive assault Swampert

for defensive back up and it can run

hydro pump itself it can run a salad

ferry and ever set to keep up with

offense and check and get fast if it

needs to but it can also run quick and

focus punch which is very common these

days just because you notice the theme

you got it you got a whale on Skarmory

and the end result can be Aerodactyl

cleans up sure or it can just be you

know Metagross Agility's eventually and

sweeps they're also good because duct

trio is a huge problem and/or this can

be a dragon dancer itself basically you

know as you can see the OP

are pretty much endless for how you want

to customize it but Snorlax anchors

these teams because the special

attackers you know they really are

uncomfortable for the other guys to deal

with and spikes is huge and warding them

off any while keeping up the offensive

assault so yeah as Aptos is nice because

it gives them back up against water so

it's not just like keep it if sweet

killer keeps getting in because the

other guys playing well then it's not

like oh well you know sera she's gonna

get overwhelmed and I'm gonna lose to

something so that those can also do

other things like now whichever Thunder

which are HP you choose use Thunder Wave

is good for slowing down offense and you

know that helps these guys who weren't

the fastest thing in the world things of

that nature and blowing up on certain

team Celebi can mean that this guy run

HP grass in peace long as you have

something for Flygon maybe this guy has

ice cream anyway this has kind of been a

convoluted rant but I think this has

Illustrated somewhat accurately the

kinds of team ocean the kinds of teams

that this set would anchor on these

kinds of mixed magneton west offenses

and the reason you would go Maggie

Thomas is yes farm dad is nice but I

want all the resources I can get that

handle the greater threats of the

metagame such as Gengar and I can deal

with Scarberry without Meg

so it's a difference in approach so uh

response is really crucial for them okay

so I think that is as most of what I

wanted to cover what Snorlax

let's see some some niche options

I mean Sonic's can run like choice band

and stuff if you want to immediately ok√∂

scarborough with it or take it to keytar

with you but remember with son or likes

it's very important that you are aware

of what you're doing and our heads up

with what you're trying to take out with

it so I like for example if you've got a

cursed self-destruct Lex you got to be

careful because you're gonna try to blow

up a scar we might protect two mice

which began gar or you might just catch

T tar instead and I mean catching

cheaters never bad but you're gonna be

like you want to be like well okay

that's nice and that's so that's gonna

make my stop dose scarier for example as

this talks could easily be

her self-destruct relaxes existence in

ADB is a never-ending struggle against

scarm Gengar tatar triumvirate of

passive damage and that is very common

and easy to use and of course that might

mean it's also very easy to abuse but

you know since all three of them are now

valid switch ins then you're going to

have to be seriously aware of how you're

going to tackle them defensively try to

permit it in you know against another

against us Aptos staring down Salomon's

maybe you go to Swampert then you go to

Snorlax to draw the HP grass since I'm

switching to a full brunt Thunderbolt

it's those little percentages that it

makes a difference in winning game you

know in living that +2 DD Tarr and

blowing it up so you don't get swept

things like that okay I think that this

should be all for this if there are any

questions I'm happy to answer them but I

think I made myself clear with how

Snorlax functions within advanced to

main sets its problems but also its

upsides so thank you for watching and I

hope you enjoyed
