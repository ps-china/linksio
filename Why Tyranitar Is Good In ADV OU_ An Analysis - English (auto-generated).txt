what's up guys I have gotten requests to

do a guide on a t-bill you before but I

figured rather than one huge video then

it would be more prudent to split every

important element of the tier up into

its own separate video so that I could

really flesh out each aspect so that you

the viewer with an interest in advance

so you get a clearer picture of the tier

this will not just be individual Pokemon

within the metagame but also things like

leads common core's threats and how to

deal with them team structures and

things of that nature

however today we're going to start

simple we're gonna start with the best

Pokemon in metier and that is Tyranitar

so opinions vary on most advanced

Pokemon like one guy might think

Salamence

is just can't live without it another

guy might think so much yeah he's okay

sometimes you can go up and down the

tier list you know Blissey Metagross

Swampert Celibidache dope Trio Gyarados

arrow cross or relaxed regice you know

all of those you know people have

varying opinions on but the one thing

that people never disagree on is that

Tyranitar stance above everyone else and

that just speaks to how undeniably

powerful it is so if we take a gander at

these handy-dandy viability rankings

that we will be visiting very often

because they are very useful then a

Terran tour is the sole s-rank and those

are some really good Pokemon he's

standing above so if you're more into

empirical evidence then I will now

present to you the usage stats for the

past five years of official team

tournaments which is when we first got

access to this technology I mean don't

get me wrong

long before this then everyone knew

Tyranitar was just the best in this tier

however well just take a look

so as you can see people use a lot of

Tyranitar because it's good em in some

of those cases then it's usage was miles

ahead of whatever number two was so what

makes Tyranitar so good well we can

start off by looking at these uh really

beefy stats with the exception of the

speed however we'll soon find out that

the speed can be fixed and also it's not

all that terrible but yeah these stats

are really good the typing is

unconventional but it's got a lot of

huge key resistances that it can do

something about because of its fantastic

bulk so it's also got some bad some bad

weaknesses no doubt about that

earthquake weakness sucks especially

with Dugtrio running around water

weakness that's how good water pipes are

but look at all into all that later now

we are going to look over the fence it

primarily uses a small disclaimer we are

not going to go over every possible

permutation of Tyranitar like we're not

going to go over the merits of

Thunderbolt

we're just gonna go over what it

commonly uses what you can expect to see

once you get a grasp on this then you

can start exploring those fringe options

like counter and whatever else but for

now we're just gonna stick with the

standards don't worry it'll still be

comprehensive so we start with a

trademark Tyranitar set dragon dance i

shouldn't take this out because this is

not predetermined yeah this is the

defining advance

oh you sweeper any team that does not

have a check to this or even multiple

checks to this is not good this is not a

tier where you have to cut corners to

make your team effective against certain

things

and you you just can't be weak to this

guy

you will sweep you off your butt every

single time or you know he'll leave your

team battered and left easily picked off

by something like Aerodactyl which

they're counters often overlap so by

skipping on one you're skimping on the

other and they're not exactly uncommon

on teams together so something to keep

in mind you want to be prepared for this

guy so what items is a commonly run well

the default of course leftovers

longevity helps to get more dragon

dances which is the goal as you'll see

shortly helps to retain defensive use

throughout the game you know means a

fella be hitting leech seed on it

doesn't mean it's permanently lost 12%

unless it gets a wish from the seer it's

only see whatever you get the idea

another option for more offensive teams

it's Lum berry because one way of trying

to slow T tar down is by status

Gengar will-o-wisp is a huge one and

there's even other things like offensive

teams that really want to lay the

smackdown on the opponent and thus can't

really afford to plop a big fat

defensive Swampert on their team to just

soak all their momentum when they're

trying to break through defense so they

might do things like run wave

Zapdos so that while titarros might take

it out at least it's not going to be

sweeping their team and after the words

is just slow and easily picked off

things like Snorlax bodies are also key

and let's see run status often as well

those are the two main ones some other

ones worth mentioning we're not going to

get in every item as I mentioned earlier

but lychee berry is purposeful often

steams it often goes with double-edged

make sure berry is when you want that

extra plus walk because you're not to be

using lefties and you don't set it up to

avoid status ie you're not going to send

in on Gengar and didi isaac uses

will-o-wisp or hypnosis

yeah lychee berry lets you get that huge

smack on Swampert or flag on or claydol

or Metagross

if you run some bulky bees which we'll

get to in a second and the last option

I'd like to go over is salic berry

because as you will see in a second that

Tyranitar sometimes needs to speed

boosts is it is not that fast dragon

dance goes a long way but it doesn't go

all the way so Southbury is usually now

a double-edge it's usually with

something like indoor or even something

else it's nice because it doesn't rely

on dragon dance to get the speed boots

necessarily I just switching it into his

abdomen durable means that instead of

being outrun into a KO and still afraid

of Zapdos now you've suddenly chased

about things of that nature

yeah the other thing I'll mention is

stuff like the boosting items remember

they're only 10% in advance so they're

not that big but soft scent for things

like swab her and also Metagross

Metagross has to come and check on

offense or silk scarf with double edge

to really hit things hard yeah or even

hard stone because Skarmory is annoying

and it also gives more of a punch when

your mid game rocks letting against

things like Snorlax oh yeah so that's

that and now we'll move over to the

fourth move d beat our 999 times out of

a thousand is going to run these three

moves there are players who experiment

with mixed variants like pure look like

one physical move that being rocks land

then ice being Fire Blast HP grass like

myself but this is the bread and butter

this is what you must assume then the

last move now that that changes so the

standard is hit in power bug this is for

Celebi and claydol important Pokemon in

the meta game really sucks when you're

dear just gets slowed down and possibly

even countered by a bold Celebi

claydol is also doing because it resists

quake slide and is immune to spikes and

it also naturally hits Flygon so we've

already seen double edged another move

speaking of by GOG is ice beam because

Flygon is so annoying and impossible to

kill for the standard DD R that it

sometimes dedicates its move just to

hitting it speaks to how important

Flygon is and how tough it is to bring

down I mean sure it's about other

benefits like it also hits clay it all

pretty well

kills Salamence without needing you to

risk a rockslide missed that's always a

nice feeling but it's primarily for

Flygon and it's primarily for use on

spikes teams because spikes will do the

work against Swampert speaking of

Swampert the other common move that

dragon is rats who are often runs or

another I should say is hidden power

grass because you know Swampert is the

go to check for teat are most teams and

apollon standing in my way is just a

Swampert then why wouldn't I just H

progressive and the last standard move

on DD tar is taunt Skarmory isn't really

a great counter because rocks like

flinches and hitting toxic and he just

phase it out and it takes a ton from

plus one rockslide and things of that

nature but it can't be annoying there's

no doubt about that

plus if you come face to face with this

farm early in the game and you're not

really going to DD in its face probably

unless you're playing really

aggressively then you've been taught to

read if you despite that you're doing

annoying things it can also be good

against leech seed 40 so you just set up

more on it if it's mono psychic can also

have a whole host of applications like

preventing Milotic from recovering after

you hit it on the switch give me you a

free switch to star lacks and then you

can see how it might work against

defensive teams

yeah so those are the primary options

now four V's standard spread is

something like this because this AV

combination is the most efficient way to

live Dugtrio and this speed is important

because at plus one it will hit 300 a

just as appropriate for hidden power bug

Ivy's like so but yeah it 299 is an

important speech said to be because that

is mutual Solomons and that's a good

portion of the advancement because samus

is always neutral and dragon dance and

very often neutral on choice made and

mixed those latter two can run plus B

but we'll get into that later so

basically it's going to be out running a

lot and the idea is that against the

things that are faster and then you take

two dragon dances against them for

example I think well you know plus speed

hundreds so we'll deal with that the

idea is against something like Jirachi

you would prefer to just get two dragon

dances because that is when you're

really unstoppable nothing is gonna beat

you up plus to speed which you might

remember is a reason for salic berry oh

yeah those plus speed 100's can be

annoying picking off because it's not

always possible matter of fact I would

say it's often quite difficult to get to

dragon dances safely so that's the next

thing we're going to explore so the

don't really one thing but some players

they prefer to deal with Dugtrio in

other ways for example duck show usually

doesn't love this which its frail I mean

it can but we will get into that later

but yeah it's usually like well I'm

gonna mess something up but Dario

revenge's me and then I'm gonna send in

my DD Salomon sir Gyarados and on that

point their physical wall be messed up

so I can keep piling it on and basically

having a plan for Dugtrio through

offense or eliminating it early in the

game by beating it out with something

like heracross or Celebi and using

either your own Dugtrio or pouring onto

so some people will get rid of this bolt

and they will just max max because not

having max attack okay usually you won't

feel it but sometimes something lives by

1% you just want to go nuts

however the main point is when you go up

to this speed then you know the bulk is

not doing that much for you so you're

just going to max attack and this is the

main selling point here because with

this then you will outrun every base 100

after a dance because it's not just

about the 328 speed base 100's with a

positive nature but even things like mul

Tris which is gonna well if you go up to

here then I'll tie it at +1 things like

slow offensive Celebi and then there's

much in each Pokemon basically the the

point here is those plus speeds AB doses

belamis sriracha's Salomon PSA's

flygon's

then yeah this is what you aim to beat

with this however you might even want to

take it one step further

Gengar normally goes up to 332 just in

case you're running spread of us up to

332 or 333 I'm pretty sure it's to just

to outrun this max good adamandeva tar

and can do things do annoying things

well willow as Todd destiny bonds just

piggie with an attack whatever and so

sometimes transfer will go one step

further

jolly however you could say well you

know why don't I just love and you know

not switching on Gengar

as if it's gonna talk me then I'm not

gonna get that second one anyway but the

main reason is offensive teams which

this more offensive version of DD Tour

is often found on aren't they're often

destroyed by Starmie and sometimes you

are going to need to grab that one dance

and just you're running to rock

especially cuz starmie hits it on the

special side so the bulk needed to take

star me with with the with max special

defense I think is 389 or 391 please

check the cops for yourselves but

without with the perfect special defense

IV then it's still this much so not

exactly realistic sometimes we need that

one dance and to go yeah so jolly is

primarily for that and it also I'll run

things like a demand dog trio which

exists primarily because most Tyranitar

are adamant so really feel like they're

not missing out how much yeah there's

other cool things like before a DD

outrunning Magneton and Metagross and

even like endeavor Swampert but come on

that is the primarily primary benefit of

jolly okay so I think we've covered DD

tar goes well with spikes goes well with

physical offense stuff Metagross blowing

stuff up just making sure I didn't

forget any options I mean you'll see

some stuff here that can be used but by

and large it is that there are the more

fringe options I mentioned earlier okay

I don't think I forgot anything so we're

gonna move on to the second big big

thing Tranter does in the advanced meta

game that is pursued so this comes

primarily from the spikes aspect of

advanced oh you

it started with fortress wanting to

spike and also spin but getting annoyed

to death by Gengar so enter Tyranitar

can trap it in a good bug in gar the

item is almost always leftovers some

players run left lung

leftovers is standard well it's nice

that Gengar can't just meet with status

you and then be annoying and also the

lack of leftovers is noticeable when

trying to take repeated hits such as get

garzooka drain so pursue always crunch

pretty much always because you have to

force the issue against Gengar otherwise

it'll you one-on-one and there goes the

entire point then other moves can kind

of be whatever I mean they can be fire

blasts they can be our grass it can be

ice beam it can be roar which is if

you're running it on spikes it's very

useful because it means that you get to

actually check things even though you're

getting off the weaker special side

notably Snorlax so on magneton teams

against Magneton teams that trap your

Skarmory and then you will still have a

phaser able to deal with it for the time

being crunched but if drops can also be

crucial down the stretch in those

matchups but something yeah that's

that's pretty much you can run whatever

move you really want some people like to

run weird things like well you can also

run Brick Break and earthquake if you're

running quiet like earthquake for Trant

are and call my Jirachi and brick break

if you're really trying to stick it to T

tar and Snorlax you don't really mind

raunchy that much but usually you'll see

modest because since this set will so

often switch into a gengar will with you

don't want to be like well I can't use

that move now because it's useless

you said she tend to be primarily

special and the the spread here is

pretty much yeah it's basic but it works

it's I mean you can take some special

attack out and you know throw in some

but f-for Gengar but usually you want

all the juice you can get and max HP

already make teach are really bulky

worth noting that a max HP TTR will

always live a plus-one earthquake from

settlements and yeah that's so that's

why some people that's another reason

why some people like nice people

Flygon is also annoying potentially and

actually being able to his Aptos because

when you drop the fiscal MOOCs then I

mean Blissey is going to annoy you

that's just kind of a given

even with brick break because you're not

very invested but especially defensive

Aptos walling you is kind of annoying

and being able to actually hit it with

ice beam was crucial because a lot of

the team that is tearing into our finds

his health on they really struggled to

actually hurt T thar ever I was at best

I'm sorry

well I said that originally this was a

fortress partner they got to the point

where he was also very common alongside

Skarmory because Skarmory wants to toxic

protect everything and you know go

alongside spikes is a really lethal

combo and Gengar gets in the way of that

and tito just removes it and then

scarlis happy so it's also crucial

against clay doll because clay doll

thorn in the side of spikes teams and

with crunch in pursuit then t-chart can

go to the totally fit lastly it can

annoy defensive Celebi which is it's

nice because a zombie can't really hurt

it that much and crunch really scares it

and pursue and all that but the primary

uses Gengar something to know is that

sometimes

Gengar will be specially defensive and

even worse use alongside Dugtrio so that

it survives the pursuit and then Dugtrio

takes care of teat are the dog shiro

transfer our relationship is

multifaceted for sure and this is one

aspect of it and so i can guard

Louis Ponte charts which because it's

safe then survived survived the pursue

and then dunked Rio and Gengar lives to

grin another day so you're gonna have to

have some sort of extra plan against

gang guard for example the robbery is

letting it in you might want to invest

in drill peck which really secures the

trap and it's also good against things

like focus punch heracross and claydol

who can be annoying if it's one of those

fast offensive sets and being able to

finish off fortress is nice too but yeah

so that's pursuit are for it yeah I

think that's most of it alright let's

move on to the mix set now mix is I put

a hit power grass first because Swampert

is just so crucial deal with for

Tyranitar and if you're running a mix

set that can't hurt and it's kind of

like well I'm not gonna get very far

so I excuse me sorry there's oh now for

a second anyway so mixed is just all

about doing damage this is going to be

seen on offensive teams primarily and

pretty much exclusively it can be

different kinds of often

offense without can be a physical

offense with a mag feasibly you might

think why Fire Blast if I've got a

magnet on for scrubbing the answers

Metagross nana gross is very often a

victim of fire blast it can be on

special offense because providing sand

is so huge and I just realized I can go

over sandstorm oh well no worries we'll

get to that

we have providing Santa's huge for those

special offense teams

and yeah it also provides a physical way

of beating down Snorlax which gives them

some much-needed rest fight against it

so item lum-lum these offensive teams

cannot afford the fat pursuit are for

organ gar and so they've got a hit at

every angle worth noting that some

people like to use pursuit artists

four-acre Snorlax but that is um that is

much rarer although this relax is a lot

hard to deal with if it's running buying

slam earthquake so pursuit or removing

an guard is actually really good but not

as common pursuit ours me mostly linked

to spikes anyway back to the mix guy and

Lum berry okay akin run lefties because

longevity against nap dose and spikes

can be nice but Lum berry is nice force

farmers toxic game peasant below it even

defensive Jirachi spamming status yeah

so this is one set in bar graphs stab

Zapdos scarm and this makes sure Blissey

doesn't get on your nerves

however you may have noticed this is not

you so hot against my GaN and clay doll

hey those guys are annoying so and

that's mentioned focus punch isn't the

most reliable thing in the world so as

far as sets go then this can be almost

anything you know I'm just clicking some

mid-range numbers because that's what it

ends up being with these special tax you

don't need that much to and you got your

Skarmory

beaten speed you're both you Metagross

beat and speed things like that so it

can go a lot in any direction you know

it can be brash mild it can even be

naughty or lonely the - defense is

basically saying hey probably I can't

kill Dugtrio in one shot anyway so

what's the point of surviving it not to

mention I'm probably not going to be out

of its range given how much Tyranitar is

in the thick of the battle and

so I would rather preserve my ability to

eat special attacks while the - special

defense option is more hey I might want

to live dog trio when its prey it's

primarily hey I want to live an

earthquake from Flygon and stuff like

that or from like a brick break from

Salamis I guess would be a more

plaintive example given that this

particular set doesn't like deal with my

god well at all but it does apply to the

next set that we're going to look over

and that is this one this is the newer

age mixed heart and this one is a lot

more simple because it's saying no bulk

all special attack speed now some attack

is fine I mean you can do things like

you know this is where the mild versus

brash conundrum pops up more let's just

assume mild way you can do things like I

mean you can even do things like frontal

only just for the extra brick break pop

against Blissey but uh it's often not

all that necessary so yeah you just want

this

you wanna you're hitting pretty much

everything hard you give up well

realistically you will threaten Zapdos

about the same I mean it's in terms of

two ação in it now while rockslide

uninvested rockslide isn't going to kill

much but the frailest Aptos anyway and

in exchange you get great much more

powerful coverage oh if you do this then

do this because you're not going to be

using that defense that much yeah Rick

bricks extra pop against our lines can

be crucial to but that's just side no so

yeah this this is the mixed are these

are the mixed stars here's a physical

Nandi deer now this this one takes many

shapes so something you may have noticed

aught about in the dragon dance section

is well you know G this this DD tar is

bulky one well it goes on those bulky

spikes teams right

not just the offensive ones but it's a

centerpiece of the bulky ones well you

know how is it a good dd sweeper if it

Ward's off all these attackers like

Stella B and Snorlax and that's a very

valid question so the answer to that is

well sometimes you want to use hits

things hard and it chases a male but

you're right then it very often doesn't

end up using DD or doesn't get the

opportunity to DV and the speed V's you

know it's a paralysis from something

like Snorlax or even like porygon

- or Reggie ice on teams without a

defensive spike seems a lot of Lisi um

thinking like Zapdos Swampert kind of

things not that that wouldn't

necessarily have a Blissey but those

very commonly don't because they've got

something like an offensive jirachi or

an air dactyl but to get back to this

then sometimes you're like hey those

speedy bees aren't doing anything dragon

dance isn't doing anything so I'm just

gonna play to Trant our strengths and

I'm going to max this the heck out so

the standard set on those teams now

remember if you're using this bulky tar

on those teams and you are facing off

against Gengar you need to have a plan

against it like Blissey Celebi refresh

claydol refresh might look something you

know that especially defensive Zapdos

but you are no longer you don't want to

have that eliminate Gengar button so

it's something to keep in mind but in a

reward this thing does great against

those remember how the pursued thing

doesn't really hurt things much on its

own it's more of a supporting kind of

guy well this thing hurts things on its

own especially with the spikes down but

even without the spikes down so and it's

it really plays at ranch our strengths

max HP max special our max attack and

power and the extra coverage from focus

much is nice against Snorlax they try to

get cute with curse laying hurt down on

Swampert on the switch while remaining

bogey and being able

chase out that Celebi jirachi and Reggie

Ison Zapdos and Snorlax and what have

you throughout the game so this is one

variant of the physical Nandi deer now

the more traditional set run substitute

who kind of to really get it up in front

of Lizzie that's a she's a time alright

um and avoid status and then really

safely lay it down on Kurt this is also

notable because it protects from Dugtrio

now while max HP is pretty good against

Doug then you know TTR takes some damage

sometimes it sometimes it just can't

help but be prone to it so but

substitute helps out with that and also

sometimes goes with hidden power grass

over overbook and in that case then you

usually well I'm definitely not killing

Doug without a sub now so I'm just gonna

go lonely so yeah that's some more

old-school approach but it's I

definitely my book oh and finally let me

go back to this but sometimes people

will run this set but except instead of

a focus punch then they like to go with

roar because it is well it's not gonna

do much against Flygon and friends then

it's potentially really really nasty

when you keep dragging things in present

with the pursuit thing if you dragged in

Gengar rather than having to switch in

who it matches beautiful and roar can do

could really make Blissey uncomfortable

and you know they keep trying to switch

to their Swampert against your transfer

with the spikes and look they got got

sent flying out and oh sorry jumping all

over my words but yeah they got sent

flying out with an unanswered 12% or 15%

or 25% depending on how many layers of

spikes you have you might think that

doesn't sound all that impressive but

then they have to do it again later

and Pokemon is one on much lower

percentages so

yeah that is the fiscal Nandi dear and

finally the this this behemoth is the

choice Bandar now a lot of Pokemon

faculty have turned to running protect

which is why the set has lost my bit of

its luster however when it comes to

switching it on special fatties and

immediately scaring them out it's

packing anything that comes in this set

is unmatched I mean there's stuff like

CV butter girls but you know with

Scarborough resistant to stab and

Magneton trapping in and actually

switching in I mean okay uh admittedly

Dugtrio can eat a plus-one or in this

case of choice band rockslide however in

terms of dishing out damage this focus

punch hounds Swamper it does so much it

is sixty percent you might think well

you know you know protect and lefties

and you know it's getting back twelve

percent before you even get a chance to

we're actually even more because a

switch in minus sixty plus six switch

its twelve protect eighteen so you have

to really make it uncomfortable unless

it's like a setup threat like Celebi but

each point is you know he coupled that

with some spikes but a lot of teams

don't even eat it it just hits so hard

and it threatens everything so

immediately on you can you can run a

bulky you can run it back so you're a

learning the Milotic that runs around

here and the bulky suicune and - defense

drop or - speed Jirachi and other things

like Metagross and skarmory and claydol

and it's you can write it fast or you

can run some bulk on it some people like

to take out of attack and run you know

some some Dougy bulk I'm personally not

one of those people I think and most

people they prefer this massive massive

600-plus Attack stat but you can do a

little mix you can throw some bulk in

there

however most rants are mostly Betar

we're going to be already Milotic and

then bold suicune because those kind of

suck to lose - so yeah alright those are

the main three entire sets

now you might be thinking well you know

these guys sound pretty strong what sets

it above all the other Pokemon I mean

Salamence can run a bunch of ferried

sets that are very powerful circuit

Metagross so in giraffe it's okay Celebi

anger and he only uses special attacks

except for explosion rare focus punch

but for the most part he just went

special tax you know even Swampert it

can be surprising what sets this guy

above everyone else and the answer is

this San scream you might think of you

know 6% on non steel rock grounds you

know big deal 6% I mean as we just said

then us Pokemon gets decided on very low

percent chances or not even chances low

percents quite often I mean how often

have you seen a game won by like a 1 to

3 percent survival that's an stream

that's to say that me Center could have

killed it twice I so be honest dream put

it like this every single Pokemon in

advance of you is shaped by the fact

that it is or is not affected by sand

stream now that might sound like mumbo

jumbo to you so let me make it clear

we'll go back to the viability rankings

now every pokemon on this list has its

viability affected in some way by the

fact that it is affected by sandstorm or

it is not and I'm talking serious levels

of being affected for example if Zapdos

recovered health in sandstorm that would

just be astonishing it would be

incredibly hard to kill one reason

Swampert is considered so unkillable

with its a protect spamming is because

it has its immune is a storm Metagross

either same thing you're hit you've hit

it a couple times and it's still good

health or at least out of range of your

attack but even if it's not running the

leftovers if it's running Lum berry or

choice band

it's not getting worn down it's not

losing six percent return one reason

that heracross sometimes okay

a couple variants of heracross like

sometimes like an all-out attacker some

defensive teams dance around it knowing

it will eventually die just because

taking some step return and when those

sets put on leftovers those teams are in

so much trouble

because it's not immediately dying even

though it's not as flashy as joy spend

or love berry but it's just as important

or salad berry heracross even teams that

are completely wrecked by salad berry

heracross quite often they don't lose to

it just because of sandstorm people put

weather moves on things like magnet on

that can afford a move slot because they

want sandstorm out of the way their

entire team's dedicated to removing

Tyranitar and changing the weather just

because that's how that's how affected

suicune its Snorlax two of the best

pokemon of the tier are affected by

suddenly suicune goes from oh I hit a

couple times with even my physical guys

and it goes down

suddenly it's unkillable even with zap

doses Thunderbolts because call mind

makes we could have no weak

Snorlax goes from yeah well I just kind

of wail on it a while and then I'm it's

gone and that's like oh my god I can't

think I can't kill this thing and even

in the face of those teams Tranter

shines because of its stats it's amazing

you often make concessions when you go

to such extreme lengths just been to a

sandstorm but you see the point so again

every single Pokemon immateriality

shaped by sandstorm in some way Blissey

can't not recovering leftovers and

sandstorm means Dugtrio quietly to a

chaos it

Celebi hates dealing with sandstorm

jirachi has such an edge over things

like Salamence and Celebi whichever way

it's dealing with it would be a call

mined or defensively with the wish

protect toxic that's your even bodyslam

because they're on even if they're not

on a timer

they've given something up just to not

be on a timer and they're not recovering

it

and even something like duck trio don't

sure got affected by said it would you

know it's uh it's not as easy to track

things I mean Celebi just recovers I

like even if Selby's hidden power grass

comes up short or Bliss ease ice cream

house and does the trick so whatever

yeah

Aerodactyl is primarily so good not just

because his counters are hit by

sandstorm spikes but also because it's a

beautiful expanses choice man attacks

all game long

unlike Salamence who is stronger but

also sand

Milotic if Milotic didn't have to deal

with sand it would also be unkillable

Flygon amazing primarily because it

doesn't take sand or spikes and sand

that's a big one porygon to another sand

casualty

so hopefully that has illustrated the

point just how important Sanskrit

Sanskrit advanced it keeps the really

strong Pokemon in check and it exerts

offensive pressure at the same time it's

multifaceted it's very very important to

the health of the metagame

so even when territory you just feel

like it's a slow blob that's getting

warmed and it's getting and just getting

killed by everything on the opposing

team

but sandstorm sandstorm is doing more

for you that you'll ever okay hopefully

now you have to stop and look at it like

wow Sierra was actually really even

though I just got my trance heart

Dugtrio non turn three so alright now we

will go over some important matchups

Trant our faces in advance and fittingly

some of the most important are the first

ones Gengar we've already gone over the

whole pursuit thing with Dugtrio

and yeah i think that one's covered

Metagross better ghost is a common DD

thar check although of course it is weak

to earthquake so some prior damage or

some spikes go a long way then sometimes

just opening it up weakening the meted

rose for its partner like Aerodactyl

that

also be crucial and the bulky Trant are

spread the 16 HP 120 defense one that

lives doctrine that also has a good

chance a very good chance somewhere

around the 70% mark I believe to live a

max attack Metagross meteor mash

non-choice main of course so sometimes

even mash isn't gonna do the job so yeah

the mix sets often I mean there are some

speedy CV grows out there so you might

want to hit him on the switch because

they're losing bulk but if you're

running a mixed set and those bulky off

and some teams and you're thinking hey

this this is the prime opportunity for

many girls to come and do some damage

fire blast

let's amend but it's not always as

simple because Swampert might also come

in and then draw the HP grass for

Metagross pivoting is a crucial part of

advanced offense because things are a

lot stronger than you'd think you know

the stereotype is all the further back

you go the weaker everything is but

things hit hard harder than you realize

without all the you know life words and

whatever so yeah you're gonna have to

pivot a lot Tran tires off the integral

in that but we'll get to it so you have

Swampert and the matchups are fairly

straightforward you know dragon dance

it's a want Swampert down or weakened

it's got I can do the lychee double edge

they can be that do the HP grass thing

it can les something else

smack Swampert up for it so then it's

all clear or clearer than it was before

pursue HP grass sometimes mix pert is

like it the prime target of going mixed

in addition to breaking stuff like scarm

bliss per course since Gengar is an

exactly a counter even if you're not

running a dark move though I should also

mention that you know you can run mixed

sets and leaf combined things like these

to your heart's content like some guys

run crunch focused punch so what do you

think oh it's a special segment to

switch my blissing I do it all day and

then you just get smacked so that's the

that's what I was talking about earlier

when you want to

just mix and match what you really need

with your trans are set once you really

get a grasp on it here anyway

so that's a big one speaking of pivoting

Trant r's neutrality to certain types is

just as important as its weaknesses and

resists

for example being neutral to Zapdos is

huge and small secret here Thunderbolt

from a stab a lecture type is actually

stronger than super effective HP grass

so for all intents and purposes yes it

is usual to Zapdos but even something

like switching pivoting is important for

let's say you check for the HP ice with

your flag on you check for HP ice by

going to flag on and then go into t tar

but that kind of thing when you don't

have a hard counter because if you're

running offense and you should run

offense because it's good and it's

powerful and it makes you a good pokemon

player to learn how to maneuver around

these tough defensive cores and

offensive threats we have your running

offense you're not going to be able to

hard counter things and the pivot aspect

of that is very crucial so that's a big

one

but I'm SAP dose versus pursuit

Tyranitar is also a and its teammates is

also a mechanic we've gone over

Scarberry I mean

Skarmory is both the great ranch our

power partner and kind of fun kind of a

not so good stop it's most of it sets as

you've noticed our pretty annoyed by it

however it gets a toxic off against non

Lum berry and then it's they can

definitely be annoying yeah feel like

most these are fairly self-explanatory

so I'm going to skip to the crucial ones

the Blissey ones are yeah the left overs

DD R I think it kind of gets old when

your DD targets sat on by a toxic

Blissey or at least doesn't even

completely sit right now so that's my

focus punch is so nice along with bulk

and so you're not relying on wasted

speedy reason anyway Celebi is an

interesting

SD Pass Celebi source dance often runs

HP fighting just because trans whore is

annoying but then it gives up coverage

against Gengar because it wants Shadow

Ball so also once recover so it can

repeatedly do this against bulky waters

so I figured that was worth mentioning

but yeah offensive salvia with Giga

Drain is because you think oh well trans

heart is good against Celebi as well

sorry um but if you're not running HP PO

you're just gonna get massacred by the

often success so that's something to

consider another benefit of the four

attacks physical set is that it's got

the bulk and the coverage to deal with

the most important threats also extends

to Jirachi cuz not on earthquake jirachi

can make life pretty miserable for non

EQ par one non roar - I suppose in terms

of like setup variants like white wish

and or sub call mine fire punch birds

are also very annoying Estela B is also

but yes um and like in the defensive

sense with HP grass they aren't so bad

as long as you keep your tar in good

condition but you're generally going to

want to bring that tart into a recovered

a forced recover from whatever so I'll

be switched on you know you're squeaking

on your Swampert yours or relaxed ears

Aptos so because that makes it a lot

more threatening pushing into the leap

to eat or or psychic you know whatever

but the psychic is good - switching to -

but switching it at least eight or god

forbid the HP dressage it's not a fun

time especially if you don't have like

these I mean transfers not a bad interim

measure just to kind of check Selby out

and you know maybe get your salamence in

on the Giga Drain which it's pretty

obligated to go for but yeah suicune is

this is an interesting matchup so a lot

of people say oh well you know advance

is nonsense because you know you have

your hard counter suicune do your DD tar

you know gets flinched and rockslide

leeches are the devil and the reason I

think that's nonsense those are the most

good advanced players because speaking

just doesn't take plus one rockslide

very well that's what another reason

and is so crucial if there was no sand

and you know bold Swedes were regularly

getting you know beaten by DD tard again

then be nonsense but that's not the kids

um we can just takes to it I mean think

about like this try countering a choice

banter antara with suicune it just won't

work so is the rockslide just hit too

hard so it mean throw spikes and you

just forget about it so that's why water

does not necessarily mean Rock hundred I

mean you can it can definitely be a

check don't get me wrong

obviously sweeping is not getting all

code by TTR anytime soon what um it's

you might want to invest in like your

Metagross your Dugtrio

even a second water you know Swampert

runs offense a lot these days which I

should probably go over offensive

Swampert like the Endeavour sets you're

gonna want to be careful in those but

even like the offensive focus punch

variants which are pretty much hydro EQ

ice beam focus punch and you know max

special attack and lots of speed so when

running your mixed ran charge you're

gonna want to go faster than ever

because those guys get pretty fast the

speed is even an option on the ice beam

brick break fire blast HP grass make

stars now because endeavor person

knowing and now running other tars is

really good is it's really crucial in

some games like the offense on offense

slugfest that's just a game changer uh

yeah so that's we're gonna go down to

Snorlax now Snorlax often runs on

offensive sets it likes to run focus

punch to really whale on Skarmory and it

also likes to run earthquake just

because Metagross some tea tar and even

Jirachi are annoying so it's not as easy

to look your ideal scenario is that your

opponent is running body slam Shadow

Ball curse lacks that never gets

paralyzed and he doesn't have a Dugtrio

and you've got it like a physical tea

tar and you just wail on him forever but

mix it up so your wise store like just

use EQ versus Zapdos every time you're

Metagross T target nailed and they're

not necessarily going to be able to

bridge the gap and do some damage back

because the other guys also got some

hell

for you Pokemon - pivoted - so you

really got to be careful so relax can

potentially make teachers very uneasy

because it seems like teach are just

dominates Snorlax so hard

oh yeah teach our kind of dog they snore

like really hard like mixed against the

combo teeth are Gengar next farm which

is incredibly common then it's it's a

mess it's horrible

that's nice it just feels like dead

weight and it's just inviting the other

guy to this completely set up and

destroy you without repercussion so yeah

like with most things tatar has a back

and forth with Snorlax and that's how

most interactions in this tier go

honestly it's the beauty of advance yeah

I'm just trying to list some things to

watch out for

Salamence teach are in medicine

sometimes I think the extent of teeth

barbed interactions that can be

considered cognitive is okay there are

three I think one is tea tar is immense

pivoting into a guitar HP grass to scare

it out but it's also got to be banded

because otherwise it's not going to kill

it in one shot another is when teachers

gotten DDS and Salamis is desperately

intimidating it and the third is when T

tar remains in range for menses plus one

EQ and revenge kills it prevents it from

sweeping um fun fact some salamence

began running DD Brick Break just for

bulky tar and also Blissey which is also

infuriating ly somehow a decent check

but yeah DD Brick Break is a thing

primarily because of bulky T tar don't

that's that's a whole whole thing

without ice beam a lot of he told will

not be able to kill duck trio in one

shot because I mean unless you're

spamming unless you mention hit it with

a max attack earthquake from this guy

then Dario will usually be able to

survive it

and yeah so ice beam or focus punch I

would say that with the proliferation of

frailer DD tars and mixed Tyranitar

then and bulky pursuit cars that can't

hit Doug the Doug has never been closer

to a fruit eat or switch invented is now

and I don't see that changing anytime

soon because the reason those sets have

risen to the forefront is because of how

good they are against the Creator

metagame so yeah that's something to

consider you know maybe you want to

start poking your teacher a little but

you also gotta remember why you're

running that speed in the first place

you know the faz app does the Starmie

the plus speed band mats things of that

nature

Starmie now they here is a fun

interaction for a while there was a

point advanced where it felt like every

other game you saw a DD Tarsus we'd get

halted by starving or it gave it the

second DD it needed because hydro sucks

oh yeah that's a bogey star B is really

it's strange it's not really good teat

our counter but it served us a lot more

than you'd think it's deceptively strong

for a supposed week bulky water it's the

same thing with my loaning actually so

you got a yeah you got a be careful

around those but you're not really gonna

see many of those the real problem is

offensive star me comes in and just

smacks things and the smacks teach are

really hard it's very close to an elbow

even when TJ's bulk it's pretty much

always in fear of dying upon taking you

know any damage so it's an interest and

it's it's the main reason I would say

for the Jolly deedat are outbreak star

me is just that devastating to those

offenses that are often angers and is

part of magnet I'm but fact when a

standard scarm bliss Gengar Swampert eat

our team has had its Scarberry Magneton

they very often will go to teat are

immediately after because they want to

actually kill the Magneton and Blissey

you know toxic protect and then it gets

all messy because unless you're running

Fire Blast you're not killing it in one

shot so it's and then maggot odd very

often gets a parting t-bolt off on it

so that's something I think is worth

noting

other than that they don't really get

any show this way much magneton use the

outspeeds teat are they run a lot of

speed but that's why that's why the Plus

speed Mick star is taking off

claydol claydol is both a and

infuriatingly hard to take out wall

fruity tour and simultaneously paid for

it to do whatever it wants like the DB

HP bug set with bulk just gets just

totally rolls over clean off

but like the DD Todd sets you're never

killing those I mean you're not beating

it down with spikes um you're not

beating down with repeated attacks it

heals immediately from your weak attacks

and it's so yeah play it off something

you got to keep in mind with thr

especially

Aerodactyl tends to pterodactyl tends to

revenge guilty tar sometimes but it's

like it also sometimes provides bait Oh

important Salamence that reminds the

important elements thing that also

applies to aro when they are locked in

choice man attacks like HP flying or a

narrow escapes double-edged the pursuit

part sometimes pursuit them and that

really helps bring them down likes

comments likes to come in on defensive

Celebi recovering and now I'm going to

scare something and you don't really

think well T tars the immense switch and

that's another reason why sometimes you

want to go for the earthquake with

events provided there's no strawberry in

the picture because not only does it hit

Swampert basically just as hard as

hidden power fly it also some actor on

TV Metagross anteater that's something

to consider

ah yes so does that with Aerodactyl

which is huge because most of those a

reason uh air attack was so scary to the

defensive team twelve her pursuit are

usually finds itself on is because it's

dick sort of the entire game i mean it

doesn't really want to switch into

attacks when it's not getting worn down

bystander spikes and first pursuit is

one of the few ways you guys we forced

damage on it yeah so there's that an

arrow also either finishes finishes d

beat our sweep or gives it the second DD

um yeah so I think that's accurate some

players have taken to running hidden

power fighting on this is a very rare

this is like fringe the sort of brief

stuff I said I wouldn't go too much into

what some people ran HP fighting on

arrow just for for the D beat our check

and also surprisingly a smacking Blissey

so and that's relaxed so there you have

that in case you want to try that out

Jolteon guilty on with t-wave Joel towns

t-wave is another way those offensive

teams tried to you know keep D beat are

scared because well another thing about

the Metagross matchup a lot of teams are

like well you know my Peter my

swampert's also offensive and next one

for some fans have or I don't have a

Swampert and I'm these minerals can hold

it off just enough for me to get my

offense without being completely counter

swept by DD Tarr and a Jolteon on T wave

is a big part of making sure that matter

gross is the only sufficient real

defense against it because at least even

if my total goes down at least teach our

won't be taking me out and Lum berries

another reason told he on is lung buries

another don't thing I see waves another

reason for Lum berry although unlike

ghazab dose you cannot get to Dedes on

toll t on because it will still have

speed you wait no no I'm sorry I'm sorry

it's so the reason you can't DD on

Jolteon my bet a hair cross hair cross

obviously obliterates the hell out of t

tar on the other hand the DD tar is

obviously going to just a hair cross can

pivot into HP grouse and like Brick

Break and stuff I mean it doesn't to

take to any attacks like even like an

earthquake Alyssa's got leftovers in

which case another another example of

sandstorm being so crucial yeah yeah DD

a lot of teams like to give hair costs

just a little bulk yeah so we can have

that chance of living DD Tyrod slide

because again

teams are frail they need to get every

instance of security against thr they

can that is how big a threat it is you

must respect it Moltres

actually loves teat are because

sandstorm means that you know your water

is Swampert

meaning HP grass is just gonna kill it

or it's going to the water is going to

have its left over nullified so it's

will-o-wisp in HP grass are going to

leave a mark with spikes down against

something like Milotic or we can you

know that's a another example of how

crucial abuses and Moltres isn't really

I mean sure it like to have its

leftovers and I would even say that it

is affected by it because it doesn't it

can't take multiple multiple hits from

like Metagross meteor mesh for example

kind of like Gengar would be able to

take multiple hits from mixed meds even

if it walks in a dragon claw but even

something like HP grass means that next

time dragon claw will cleanly - AKO it

um things like that so it's another

example of sand but yeah it's generally

generally appreciated and of course it

also in terms of tea tar then you know

willow is not doing so good even if it's

faster I not doing so good because it'll

give a DD tar I love Divi tar of the

free BB and that's why some vultures

like one reason Moltres likes to run

roar it wraps up spikes on Blissey but

it also prevents teacher from setting up

on it remember whatever it takes to make

sure that Katie tar does not sweep you

worth considering um and it doesn't like

pursuit are either because pursuit or

isn't I'm scared of HP grass it's got

the bulk pursuit I mean on the on the

bright side pursuit isn't going to KO it

but it's still dry run afraid of bran

tonight you must respect rockslide if

there's one thing about teat are you

really don't want it if you're gonna be

taking a chance on a set you better have

a good reason you but it better be

educated that would be like no I just

don't feel like he would run rocks lie

time pursuit re you know is he totally

could and it would be totally valid just

like you in the team builder you would

respect

DD car even if you don't think your

opponent for whatever reason would run a

DD tar which by the way is stupid he

very well easily could or thing very

well easily could

because a good pokémon no matter what

their statistics and trends say it's not

like it's some obscure threat you

brought up from the vault of obscure

nonsense but yeah I think that point is

made clear yeah now if you have

confirmed or like if you're really

certain based on reasons like I don't

think he's rock slag because his team

means ice cream to deal with flying on

or whatever then yeah sometimes against

pursuit or you can stay in an HP press

and be on your way but something to

consider

Milotic Milotic is like sweet food in

that it is a prime reason why waters are

not necessarily rock counters because

it's really smacked by those rock slides

of course it's surf actually hits hard

um one thing about bolts we cool with

that 2:06 special attacks that sometimes

it fails to to at KO max HP to tar with

leftovers

hello he doesn't have any such problems

my oolitic is going to hit your teach

are really hard if if it comes to that

so uh yeah it's a reason why sea meet

our likes to run speed and is also

probably the best thing you can have

against a mixed Tyranitar you're not

gonna be scratched too much with this so

if you're running that kind of mixed

offense stuff with that's ran target

variant you must have a plan for Milotic

you are gonna have to abuse it really

really hard otherwise able to sit on

your meds teat our armada for days and

with the mixed offensive Swampert and

that exists now to while we've gone over

that dynamic yeah choice bands plug on

is also a prime to our partner because

kacang car is really annoying and you

don't want to run HP goes because that

means you don't have HP bug and hitting

Celebi is really important so uh yeah

and CB tar and flying on is also it

loves t tar sand it makes it stay even

against things that wall I like my

yellow and P to you know force to

recover because next time it's gonna get

rough earthquake hits even like Swampert

decently

yeah it's both a good partner and a good

check

except for ice cream which again if

Flygon was not a thing you probably

would never see ice cream on t tar its

Flygon it is just that much of a problem

I mean it's got good coverage but

flygon's the main reason so yeah like on

his big deal and it's also one of the

plus B base 100's that Qatar and decided

it was tired of getting outrun by after

a single dance and one would just put

tea tar in degrade so oyster is an

interesting relationship it's generally

now if you see Quester

and Teeter Teeter is going to be either

DD or one of the mixed sets and that's

pretty much the only relationship those

two have um yeah yeah I mean you could

technically say clothes for Bates and

Gengar so you could use pursuit are but

generally if we're using moisture you're

going more the offensive route and

you're not going to be pursuing Gengar

like that so uh yeah they don't really

faceoff much so bori bori likes to spin

on scarm and for it to not have it's

been destroyed by Gengar then you have

rana tar and you also got to watch out

for Dugtrio and 4e also tends to

compromise teams defensively because

while it can provide span it also

doesn't really counter much it it was

worth quick it counters a lot of manager

experience meaning like leftovers EQ HP

grass his yeah like before it just

doesn't do enough you know like it can't

have all the moves it wants it wants EQ

and explode but it also wants if he goes

because meanwhile my games are so bad

and you know without a HP ghost or bug

and it's gonna lose the clay at all and

it's just he's earth yeah it's it's a

mess so T TR helps out a lot with that

and yeah I mean for e needing pursuit

are so badly is partially what led to

scarm overtaking it because

if your pursuit are you kill the Gengar

and yet then get a get stuck try out the

Skarmory can still be a massive massive

threat

where's fortress is kind of like whoa

can guards this so I suck so yeah

ptoo I'm not really a teacher check

except sometimes against experience it's

not really a great switch but with tea

weight that can be really annoying teams

that the mixed ARS find itself on and it

was also a reason that t20 when poured

on to became big on those Columbine

teams that really wanted of trio dead

then or just offensive teams I want to

dunk trio down in general then that was

a reason T tar started running taunt

again because it would be like well it's

not really a great deity tar switch but

it unlike my loading it's we need to hit

to conserve it only needs one you have

to be ruined and that's another reason

for a lung as well so uh yes we're gonn

to is not not really a check but a big

reason why those it's like Milotic in a

way i you're really gonna need to abuse

it hard if you're running one of those

mixed offense it's a it alongside my

logic is a big reason why Snorlax is

really important on them

probably Gyarados care else is kind of

like meds and that teach person that

stays alive to check it except it's a

lot weaker than vents that's pretty much

the only relationship I mean Gyarados

also intimidating uh t tar is also good

for it's got a good synergy alongside

Metagross so that Metagross is eating

the full force of an earthquake and it

can go back to Gyarados potentially for

even more intimidating cause you can't

you really won't be DD on a Metagross so

yeah we're gonna skip these guys because

i don't think it's as important um just

yeah so i think we're gonna call it

there i hope this gave you an accurate

picture of what Tyranitar does in

advance overused and i hope to continue

this series with with other pokemon and

strategies and the advanced will you

tear so

if there's something you really want to

see before anything else like hey do

Metagross or do why call mine

Celebi sucks or something like that then

let me know otherwise I'll be enjoyed

and I will see you next time
